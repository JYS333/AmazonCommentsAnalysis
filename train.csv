"When you buy new, not refurbished beats, at FULL PRICE, you just might get Jason’s used beats. Jason didn’t even have the audacity to save the wrapping, put the cords in nicely or delete his name. They’re even scratched and greasy. Such crap that this got returned and passed through to another customer. So disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Bought this with a Gift Card that I got for Christmas and was excited to get these when it comes in the mail because I’ve always wanted a pair of beats. I just got them in the mail right now and these turned out to be FAKE! I compared them to my sisters beats that her boyfriend got her and also watched YouTube videos and they are way different from what I got. I knew there was a catch to this and it doesn’t even match the description. Will be filing a return claim and will keep updated on status. Buyers Beware!,1.0 out of 5 stars
Don't buy it - waste of money! Keeps breaking and only one side works. I've sent this off to be repaired and it broke again after one week. Not a happy customer. They repair process was a joke - no email notifications were sent so I had no clue what was going on with the status. You have to sign into Amazon and view your order to actually see the updates from the repair. 2 thumbs down!,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Heads-up - this is a lengthy review - but when you are considering a headphone at this price you deserve as much review as you can get to help you decide! I will rate by topic so you can also focus on what is most important to you. Let's start with context. These are my first Beats headphones - wired or wireless. They are not of course my first wireless or wired headphones. I have several wireless headphones including Jabra Move and Jaybird BlueBuds X. I also have several wired headphones with my favorites being KEF M500 (on ear) and Oppo PM-2 (over ear). My sound preference in a headphone is crisp and clear highs and mids with a presence and ""definition"" of bass - but not over done. Yea, I'm not a bass-head. So here we go...

WIRELESS (5 / 5):
Right off the bat, this is where these headphone excel, and why I considered and bought them in the first place. They are by far the easiest bluetooth headphones I have used to pair and manage with multiple devices. This of course assumes you are very deep in the Apple eco-system - which I am. I use these headphones with an iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Initial pairing was simple and automatic with my iPhone - place it next to it, turned it on, hit accept and done. Then in seconds the headphone showed up in all my Apple devices! And switching between what device is connected and active is just as easy. I could never get previous wireless headphones I owned to play nice with multiple devices even though they supposedly supported this feature. One wireless headphone always went back and forth between my iPhone and iPad even when I was in the middle of listening to music on my iPhone. Not so with the Solo3! And the range and battery life are incredible. I have owned my Solo3 for over a week and I am still on the initial charge. So hands down wireless performance is the best feature of these headphones.

COMFORT (4 / 5):
The Solo3 is an on-ear headphone and for me they are actually quite comfortable. The leather pads are comfortable and seal well - though they are not as soft as the pads on my KEFs. But maybe they will soften over time. The ""clamping"" of the Solo3 is firm and keeps the headphones very stable during moderate activity but not so tight that they bother my ears at all. The headband liner is comfortable for me too - I don't seem to have the rubbing problem some people have mentioned. And the plastic construction (see again under quality) actually has one plus in that it keeps the headphones light. I almost don't notice they are on my head until... The good seal and firm/thick pads cause my ears to heat up after about 30 mins so I do have to take them off for short ""cool-down"" breaks.

QUALITY (3 / 5):
This is a hard one to judge short term so my rating here is certainly preliminary. Bottom line - admittedly there is a lot of plastic here. Yes, it is a plus under comfort as it keeps the headphones light. But when you get in to this price range you defiantly see more metals and leathers and less plastic. And some wired headphones I have are so solid they have lasted me over a decade! I am not sure I will be able to say that about these headphones. And a 1 year warranty is not very confident - some headphones starting at this price point offer up to 3 years. It would certainly inspire confidence if Beats backed these a bit more and made me feel like the plastic construction was solid and truly there for comfort (weight). That said its too early to bash longevity yet.

SOUND (4 / 5):
Ok now the final and most subjective topic - the sound quality. Recall my sound preference - not a bass-head. When I first heard about these headphones with the new wireless chip - I was interested because of all the hassles I had before with bluetooth headphones. But because they were Beats I struggled to decide to purchase or not. I have not owned Beats because Beats headphones I listened to in the past were definitely too much bass for me - thudding and muffled. But I decided to give it a try - I could always return them. They are not going back! The sound is actually a pleasant surprise. Yes, they are more bass then what I own now - but they sound more balanced then what I remember. You can hear good mids and highs - though they are certainly more reserved. And the spatial separation is very good - these give a full and well spaced sound that makes you feel like you are indeed in the middle of the studio or concert. They excel with more Rock then Classical, so there still is a place for my wired headphones, but I also don't feel like I have to sacrifice sound quality to get wireless convenience.

OVERALL (4 / 5):
Overall, these are very good wireless headphones - they are now my primary go to wireless headphones for sound quality and convenience across all my Apple devices - though I am keeping my set of wireless Jaybirds for intense workouts only. They are even what I turn to now over my wired headphones for most music/podcasts unless I want to immerse myself in some Acoustic, Classical or Jazz where I still prefer my wired options. Value is good - plastic to price ratio is not ideal - but it is offset by the wireless simplicity and sound. If you want a no-compromise wireless experience, you should at least consider these headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars
At this point I have had the headphones 4 months and now they won't connect to Bluetooth. I also tried to connect them to a PC for an update but they will not connect via USB. I have tried to reset the headphones but that didn't work either. In contact with Apple Support now. This is my second pair of Beats and the other ones had to be sent in to be repaired because the right side stopped working.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I got these headphones 4 months ago and for the first two months, the were great. A couple of months in, I started to have some connectivity issues and the earpads started separating from the base. Then the rubber headband started to come off.
Finally, a couple of days ago, the headphones died completely. I charged them to 100% and the still won't turn on. I bought wireless Sol Republic headphones a couple of years ago and they worked fine until I lost them and had to buy new headphones. I got these Beats thinking they'd be an upgrade.... They're cheaply made sold at a ridiculous price. NOT AT ALL WITH THE MONEY. THEY ONLY LASTED FOUR MONTHS!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Hey, So I'm writing my review on 7/18/19. I just received my beats solo 3's in the mail, and I ordered the matte black version. I read the previous comments that stated that people got fake beats in the mail and that sucks. I can't speak for those people, but the pair I received is real. I watched a couple of youtube videos to validate if mine were real and they in fact were.

Just hoping this review helps in case someone read the previous reviews of this product from this seller and was having doubts. I definitely had doubts and was nervous about getting a new pair, but am definitely relieved that mine were real and new. Hope this helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"So I have had these bad boys for about 2 weeks now. Let me tell you they work great! They came in the mail brand new sealed with all the cords and case. These have been used for gym workouts and casual listening. They do become slippery when working out hard, so I would not recommend running with these. I was skeptical at first but I have bad no issues so far. Make sure to buy a hard case as well to keep them safe!! Stand by for a later update!

UPDATE:
Going on 2 months now and they are still running strong. I used them mainly for workouts, running, and plane rides. No issues that I can detect. These are worth the money!

9 month review!!! These are still amazing. No issues yet. Keep in mind these are beats and very fragile.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Be careful. These are advertised as new and sold by Amazon directly; however, when they arrived, they don't work at all. Did not pair initially, then once paired, it went back into pairing mode every 2-3 minutes and kept losing bluetooth. Would not turn on if it was not plugged in and would not do a software update. Contacted Apple for support and it turns out the serial number on the headphones do not match the serial number on the box they came in. Apple says according to the serial number on the device, they were purchased last fall and are NOT new and have already been reported as defective. I'm very angry after spending this much on headphones, I expect them to be new and defect free. Returning for a refund and will shop elsewhere.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these particilar set of headphones for my grandson on May 27,2017. He was so excited! He receieved the headphones on May 29,2017. Three weeks ago the headphones broke . I told him it would be no problem as we bought the Square Trade insurance. Imagine my surprise to find out there was no insurance, In my grandson’s excitement he may not have done so. Nevertheless these expensive headphones should not break in four months time. I saw on order site that there was no restution for this product as the allotted time had expired.
The outcome of the product has really bothered me. Thus this email. I want to warm people against buying these particular set of headphones especially with the Holiday season around the corner. My grandson is almost 15 years old and is a responsible boy with expensive “toys”. $200+ is a lot of money to end up throwing away.

"So sad, I really wanted to like these. I used to love Beats.
The GOOD - And as far as looks go, the are fabulous - I got the rose gold & they are one of the only headphone that I actual feel fashionable wearing.
And they fit my ‘girly’ head; meaning that almost all great headphones seem to be made for guys. Why is that?! Don’t girls want the fabulous sounding headphones too (rhetorical question). Thus these fit comfortably AND they don’t look like I’m about to pilot a helicopter, mow the lawn or on the tarmac directing airplanes.
To repeat - this look and feel awesome!!
Now the BAD - the sound quality is lame. What happened Beats?? Dre?
I’m guessing that these are made to appeal to a wide variety of listening tastes.
Yes, they are probably better than most headphones made for general call/cell phone use.
Oh also GOOD - they pair flawlessly with my iPhone 7. Easy as pie to set up. And they auto connect perfectly. Also, they seem to have a better than most headphones length of Bluetooth connection.
But I must go back to my original point - the bass and over all rich quality of sold is totally lacking. It’s not horrible but it’s like listening to music “lite”, good but not great. Kinda like eating fat frozen yogurt, it isn’t bad, but is it it Haagen-Dazs... not even close",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are not made for anyone looking to seriously exercise in them. After 6 months the fake leather covering the ear pieces came off from sweat and that is even with beats protectors on. It’s now June 2018, so they two month out of the one year warranty and they simply snapped in half when I was taking them off at the gym. I keep them in a hard shell case, not rough on them. They simply feel apart from exposure to sweat during workouts. I’m very VERY disappointed",2.0 out of 5 stars

"When they worked, the sound quality was good, and it didn’t take long to charge. I bought them in August (gave them to my daughter in September for her birthday), and the mic cord came apart almost immediately - the mic cover came off). By January 1st, one side didn’t work. We’d gotten her a set of wired Beats a few years ago, and she treated them very well. The leather wore out around the ears, but there wasn’t a scratch, and she insisted they were still perfect. Because she was so good with them and used them so much, we surprised her with these wireless ones. The problems with the mic and one side were not caused by damage. The glossy finish is still in perfect condition, and she is meticulous with her things. I’m just so disappointed in the quality. The wired ones we bought a few years ago (3 sets) still work; so I guess we won’t be upgrading to wireless anytime soon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"RETURNING!!!! I opened the box and the first thing I noticed was that the headphone case was cheap. I own a pair of the Solo 2 and the case is nice soft material. This feels like a cheap backpack from the dollar store. The biggest problem was the Bluetooth. I would connect to my phone and after only 5 seconds it would disconnect every time, even when I stayed close to my phone it still disconnected within seconds, after trying over 10 times, with 4/5 battery life. I am very disappointed in the company who sent me this junk. Never buying from these people again. Buy from Best Buy. I just saw that they are $10 cheaper, and more trust worthy, straight from the store. 1/10, 0/10 if I could. Buyers Beware!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Beats Solo3 is not the best audio out there, but the crazy thing is that I find myself wearing them more often than another $500 pair of headphones that I have just because they are so convenient and easy. They fold up small and are easy to carry in a backpack, holding up well to pretty tough treatment. The battery lasts forever and if it does die, you can get a whole study session of juice for like 5 minutes of charging. Connecting to my MacBook, iPhone, or iPad is so easy using the M1 chip and the syncing of settings through iCloud that it makes connecting other bluetooth devices seem super cumbersome: Just turn the Solo3 and choose it from your list of devices (no need to disconnect from one device before connecting to the next). And finally, they look good and are very comfortable.

So even though they aren't the best headphones I own, they end up being the ones I use the most because of how convenient, tough, long-lasting, and easy they are. Even though I said the sound isn't the best, the sound is great. The only time that I can discern that they are inferior is head-to-head, and even then, for some types of music these are preferred. They are certainly tuned to handle bass quite well, but they aren't overly bass-heavy as some other reviews indicate. So the sound is more than passable, quite good, and even superior for some music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"A lot of people always seem to nitpick about about the items that they purchase off of Amazon. They always talk about how the sound quality could have been better, they always somehow find a reason that they think it's good enough to complain about the comfortability. Here's what I think about the beats that I bought:

They are one of the best headphones a person can ask for. I do not understand why people tend to complain about the comfortability when they have cushions for your ears. That's what's really important when it comes to wearing headphones that goes over your head. The sound quality is exactly what you would expect from a popular company. The sound quality is amazing along with the different colors that you can buy. When I first bought my headphones I had a question mark over my head because it wasn't turning on, but that was only because it needed to be charged. And that is the beauty of Beats Solo 3, if your headphones is dead, you can also still play music with the wires, just simply plug it in your phone and in your Beats.
I do not know if it is just me because due to the fact that I lost my other pair of Beats it's been such a long time since I touched it let alone wear it, they do seem to feel fragile, all the more reason to place a warranty on an item that happens to feel fragile. Now the question that everybody seems to be asking is ""is it true that it only takes about 5 minutes to charge the headphones completely, and is it true that the battery life last up to 40 hours."" Well the answer depends on how much you use your headphones. There is 5 LED lights that indicates the percentage of your battery of the headphones. If the LED light is on the third light, that just means that you are at least 50 to 75% of battery life left so in other words, it would take a roughly 5 to 10 minutes to charge it which isn't bad. But ultimately it is pretty fast when it comes to charging headphones especially when it turns out to be Wireless. The volume button Works along with the pause and play button, the button that turns on the wireless headphones work. It even makes that musical noise when you are officially connected to your device, and it does it again when you turn it off. I am able to extend the headphones. I am able to fold them which is a definitely a must for me because when I am finished with my headphones for the day I usually fold them.

In conclusion, if something happens to your headphone such as a shortage on the right or left side of the headphones, if you have a warranty all you have to do is just call Apple and they should be able to fix it either call Apple or whatever warranty you are affiliated with. In addition, if you have a computer or a laptop you should download this beat app where you able to update the headphones, I will not go into details but you could always look it up on your spare time. With that being said I'm giving this product and five star and whoever purchase it in the future, I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy what you bought. Not to mention that this was on sale because originally it was $300. Now in the beginning of my review I was talking about how people tend to nitpick and and complain about things that can be easily fixed. And I was very serious about that, they are the ones who bought the item off of Amazon if something happens to that item it doesn't take as much to file a complain and get a refund and get your money back after you give them back what has been broken. Since a lot of people gave it a one-star, I had to double think about me buying this. But when I purchased it it turns out to be great just as I was expecting, no issues to the point where I would want a refund.

Oh and by the way, the true difference between Beats Solo 3 wireless and Studio 3 is that studio 3 have the ability to cancel out noise, solo 3 although you are able to increase your volume the point where you are not able to hear a single thing from the outside world, there is still a chance where despite your volume being all the way up the environment that is around you could be louder than your music. So it is not fully a noise cancellation headphones. But these headphones are beneficial for me because I'm not always in an environment that is loud enough to where I have to blast it up to 100.

And this is where my review ends",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Audio quality is amazing and the design is, of course, slick. However this is the second time I've made a Beats purchase, and I've decided I won't be purchasing anymore of their products. Maybe it's because I use headphones so much, but with both products, they lasted less than half a year before something went wrong. In this case, the cushion was coming apart, and I was having trouble connecting with my laptop several times. Sometimes it would disconnect out of the blue and I would have to restart my laptop to get it to connect again. They weren't very comfortable on my ears either, so I think I'd prefer an over-the-ear headphones because this one squishes down on mine. It's a shame because the audio really is amazing! And I love the design and color, but for this price, it's not worth buying, at least not for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Got 2 pairs at once for me and my girlfriend who use them all the time with our iPhones. I have an iPhone 7 and she has an iPhone 6. I love the new pairing tech apple has in the iPhone 7's and up and these headphones are just great. You can use wires if you want to, which I think maybe makes the base a little better, though I am not sure how accurate that is. Either way, I LOVE THESE headphones! One thing I am surprised about is the battery life on these things. I charge them once a week and often fall asleep with them on Audible and wake up to them still playing all night and still only charge about once a week. The battery life is amazing, the range is amazing, the weight and design, packaging and comfort is just all top notch. I thought the battery life might be due to the W1 chip in my iphone 7 which uses the same tech as the Air Buds, but my girlfriend who uses regular bluetooth with her iPhone 6 reports the same ridiculous battery life. She also says that she charges hers once or twice a week. These are easily the most comfortable beats thus far for over the ear. Head fatigue is almost non existent.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Item arrived on time and well packaged. This was my first ever Beats product and I absolutely love it. These headphones are much better in my opinion than either the Bose noise cancelling headphones or the Jabra headphones I have used in the past. Excellent sound with rich bass and easy to use functions. As others have mentioned these headphones do have a deep bass sound which I think is great. The re-chargebale battery is wonderful and I still have not had to charge them after a month of a fair amount of use. They even fold up to put into the little storage bag that comes with them. These headphones work particularly well with my Apple devices as there is an Apple wireless chip in them. These are great mid-range headphones for a fair price. Quite frankly, these are the best headphones I have ever had. I highly recommend them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Just a heads up, these are knock offs. Pieces were falling apart the second I opened the box so that was my original reason I started the return process. I had no experience with beats so after I decided to return them because they were falling apart I went to Best Buy and tried on a pair, when then I realized they were not the same thing at all. I’m really surprised amazon is allowing this. I didn’t believe the other reviews, I thought they had some accidental fluke. Nope, they’re completely fake and very cheap bad plastic. Save your money and your time. $20 ear buds would be a wiser purchase, or save a little more and buy the real thing.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound was good, but the ear piece part was small for my taste. It put a lot of pressure on the outside of my ears...it wasn't super comfortable. If you have large ears, you may want to try them on first. But sound wise, they were great.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Let me start by saying that I got Beats after they lowered the price to $150 (I think they were $300 or something like that before September 2019). If I had to pay $300 I'd probably send them back and try some other brands known for the sound quality (Bose, Sony). Anyway, for $150 I'm pretty happy with the purchase.
First of all, they are very stylish. If you're looking for a product with a cool design, you won't be disappointed. I personally like the way they look and it feels good to have them on. Beats are easily adjustable, not too heavy, overall they fit pretty well.
It's super easy to connect them to all Apple devices. iPhone, iPad, MacBook, you name it. I connect them to a few different devices and never have any issues.
Unfortunately, the sound is not that great. It's not bad but I personally don't see any difference between beats and regular AirPods. I was expecting more for $300 headphones. Also, I don't recommend using beats when you work out and move a lot (running, jumping, cardio exercises). Other than that I have nothing to complain about. I think they are worth $150 but this review would be way different if the price was 2x higher.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are great! They are authentic and come in the original packaging. I use them mostly to study (I listen to static noise) and I wear them during my runs. They fit a little snug, but that may be because I have a large head. They feel most comfortable without my glasses and earrings.
When I listen to music the sound quality is amazing. I put them on when I am cooking and it really puts me in the groove. My chef skills have definitely been enhanced following the purchase of these headphones. If you can't cook, buy Beats for some good eats!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This purchase was a part of my rookie intro into headphones. I travel about 80% of the time with my job, airborne, and was having a hard time finding headphones that were both compact and functional. I bought these on a whim during Amazon prime day - since they were on sale - and only wore them a handful of times. They are nice and have good sound quality, but after only 30 minutes of use, start to REALLY hurt your ears... Especially since they sit right on top of your ears. To put it into perspective - I am a petite framed female with normal to small ears. I imagine if they are uncomfortable on me (5’2 / Small oval shaped head) they would certainly be uncomfortable on most people. I ended up purchasing Bose QuietComfort 35. The price point hurt, but holy %*!@ has it been worth it. I can wear my Bose headphones all day (literally) with zero discomfort. Plus, you can remotely manage them with their app. My advice - spend the extra money and buy something else. Even my cheap pair of Sony headphones were more comfortable than the Beats. Not hating - hoping this helps.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Like many others, I read the reviews of all products and filter out the reviews I feel are retaliatory or based on a shipping/seller problem verses a product issue. BUT, in this case my biggest and only issue with the Beats Solo3 is the product! It's made from cheap materials and not as impressive as the marketing campaign that launched the Beats brand. They are made of flimsy plastic, the ear cushions are made of foam and pleather that becomes oily, have fit issues, fiction and performance problems and the additional heat they generate around your ears is astonishing (maybe i should use these while snowboarding)! I've had mine for 5 months and shocked on how many issues I've had so far. Some background, I buy A LOT of items through Amazon and other retailers (some people might say I have a problem, I say I have my PhD) and this one of the worst purchases I've made! Issues I've experienced so far include; won't charge, won't turn on, won't turn off, Bluetooth not connecting to an iPhone or the car, pleather ear covering ripped on the left ear, plastic sleeve housing left speaker broke and now held together with rubber bands (about to upgrade them to electrical tape though 👍🏼) now the entire left ear housing has broken and will also get the electrical tape treatment. DO NOT waste your money or PLEASE go into a store so you can see them for yourselves and you'll be prepared for what your getting. I wish I could still return mine......procrastination gets you every time!!!

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I used to have the Solo 2 wired beats and, after many cable replacements, I figured an upgrade to the wireless would be my solution. After nearly a year without beats, considering my stubborn self didn't want to pay for yet another replacement cable, getting back to these was like heaven. They sound absolutely amazing, providing a wide range and and depth in the music. I barely put them up past half the volume and am just stunned by the quality. Even though the Solo 2 were already fantastic, they truly outdid themselves on the Solo 3.

My only issue, which I'm unsure if it's an issue for everyone or just me, is that the clip for the bag and accessories was rather loose and did not close correctly. This caused me to lose all of my accessories and the bag. Luckily I had been wearing the beats at the time so I didn't lose those but I was incredibly upset that I could have and did lose some stuff. However, Amazon support was great and solved the problem quickly.

All in all, I really love these headphones so much. They have a great feel and sound and the ability to go cordless is such a fantastic feeling.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these headsets to replace a set of in ear headsets (Mpow) that just never quite were satisfactory for use at the gym and for general use. Never thought an over the ear product would work for me until I read the reviews on these Beats Solo 3 by Dr. Dre. So I had to try them.
This is my initial unsolicited review after about a week. I have the matte black color, which sometimes Amazon varies in price to drive choice. I got mine at a good time, though- Cyber sales- so it was a very competitive price.
What did I expect going in? Before I opened the box (quite a package, if you're into that sort of thing!) had good confidence that the bass sound quality would be outstanding from reputation of the Dr. Dre Beats brand. Rewarded in that regard and many other aspects as well.
Besides that though, there is a wired connection cable, and a charging cable packed inside and all the 'foo-foo' packaging you might expect from Apple, just to mention accessories you might expect.
I'm going to concentrate on what most people buy a headset for. So let's get on to the important stuff:
• Sound quality. It's unlike and greater than 90% of the headsets I have used. As an audio engineer (my past life) I have used plenty. The size of the cups is not an unusual one if you wear a lot of headsets- just over the ear as opposed a full surround, found I prefer this style these days.
• Great build quality/design of the ear cups. Fit well and very comfortable. I can easily wear for an hour at a time. After that, they begin to feel warm-ish (read I want to take them off for awhile). Most of my wear is inside the gym, haven't gone outside for a run with them, may be different impression.
• Outstanding battery life. I got them at what appeared to be 100%, apparently they weren't though. On my iPhone (11 Pro) when I looked, the power read 50%. SO I thought to run them down to the ground. I put them on days later and it read 25%. Used further for a work out for 1.5 hours and still good (20%). Gave up and recharged 'em. I will report back on a running time after full charge.
• Isolation. An over ear headphone has MUCH BETTER isolation from external sound by it's nature of the cups surrounding the ear. I my opinion these headsets DO NOT need further noise cancellation, with the possible exception of air travel. Further noise cancellation would likely affect sound quality. Have not tried the noise cancellation version which is MUCH more expensive. I have a pair of Sony noise cancelling over-the-ear type headsets for travel that do not sound as good as these but cancel plane noise VERY WELL. The thing is, they don't sound as good.
• Controls and pairing to several devices. Bluetooth is flawless and fast to pair to new devices (admittedly all Apple). Controls on the headset (pause-play,volume up/down) are VERY responsive. I did find that going from one device paired to another always requires that the second pairing be connected at the device again. The headset want to stay paired to the original device until a new device is paired. Once you have that concept it's easy to switch between sources.
• Microphone on a call sounds great to the caller and the caller sounds great in the headsets. I don't know where the mic is exactly but wherever, it works!
Listening test. I'm listening to the headsets as I write this review. I enjoy music and my favorite sounds are nothing short of magnificent played on these headsets. My positives about that are fabulous bass (expected). My only criticism is the ""mushy"" highs. So I had to engage an equalizer to improve the highs for me. On Music app you can fool with the settings. I pictured what works for me and I admit to some hearing loss, so what it means to you is only that there is no actual reproduction of ultra low bass (<30-40Hz, I'm guessing) or ultrahigh frequencies (>12KHz), which I think is to be expected on these type headphones. What is there is fairly well flat but could use boosting (again for me) and tweaking in the mid-range high frequencies. I feel that resulted in a major improvement. In my case with known music as the source and still with a bit of bass coloration, I found a sweet spot, to EQ settings as shown in the picture.
Review conclusion. An outstanding quality product! If there 4.75 stars I would give it that overall rating. Actual Rating. I'm taking off 1 star overall for less than perfect sound, likewise the bass quality because it was too overpowering out of the box and affected the frequency response. Apple knows something about audio and many folks will disagree with me. OK. My fix was minor on the computer source. However the fix for iDevices is not as easy, though I'm betting there is an app for that or soon will be because it's worth doing.
I may just get that app and use it, because these headsets are a pleasure to wear and use.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love these headphones, we will buy another Beats Solo3 next month after we save up. A bit spendy as compared to Sony 950 set that we returned last week, but absolutely night and day difference in sound quality. The Sony set had superb bass, but there was a trade off as treble and midrange suffered quite a bit (lacking). These Solo3 have a very balanced and deep bass, as well as detailed midrange and treble. Probably the treble was a tiny bit lacking, but full treble can be harsh I have found. I was thinking my Planetronics Backbeat did better with overall sound but after listening to them again to compare, I found the Solo3 has the mid and highs covered better as it takes the ""harshness"" out of a lot of it. Kind of cuts off the harshness of not only the treble and mids, but also the bass . No overpowering bass, but totally enough to make me happy . Listen to a lot of dubstep, and these are very pleasant sounding with that genre of music !!

Folding them up to put in the carry case didn't feel like I was going to break them, which I was worried about before I purchased. For the price they can not be beat, very happy (oh did I say that already) ? lol",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Update January 18 2019
After having to have my beats replaced FIVE times in less than a year, a person in a higher position talked to me. He made sure I got a new pair of headphones AND a new warranty. I did send them in for a replacement two days ago, because the ear coverings had started coming off again and would not stay in with the card trick. So I had that done while it was under warranty. I know that these beats won’t last forever, I am currently seeking a better alternative for when that happens.

Let me first say, I love my beats. The sound is much better than the past beats headphones. But the build quality is horrible. I knew they didn’t have the best build, but the fact that I’ve had to have my solo 3’s replaced twice in less than a year is absolutely ridiculous. I take very good care of my headphones, I’m not rough with them at all. These are way too expensive for the quality you’re getting. At least apple has been helpful.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited a year to post a review as I wanted to see if they would last. Yes the sound is great. Yes the noise reduction is wonderful, but if they only last a year, they are not worth the price! I've seen comment after comment from Beats owners that after a year or less couldn't hear sound from one side. To have them repaired is $129. There are you tube videos showing you how to tear apart the faltering side and pull wires, solder and put it back together, but if you don't have the skill set, you're stuck with Beats that only have sound in one ear. Get a less expensive pair of headphones. You'll be so much happier if they break and you are not out $229",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I rearrange my home office recently. This office is my primary workplace. In the rearrangement, my computer hutch and my desk are on opposite walls. As I moved back and forth my old standby Grado SR60 cans ended up pulling out of the headphone jack or worse pulling the computer on the floor. I was looking at the Beasts solo 3 wireless as they seemed very similar to the Grados. The price was right on Prime day.

These are on ear cans so I don't expect perfect noise cancellation. That said the experience is better than expected. The sound excellent and very transparent. I can go from bass heavy rock to string quartets without needing adjustments. Wearing duration is very good, with two to three hours with fatigue. Learned not to bend too far forward or the headphones will fall off. Bonus finding, these headphones are very good for phone calls. I was listening when paired to my iPhone when I had a phone consultation. I forgot I was wearing the beats and when I realized I did not make the switch to my usual phone headset I asked about my voice clarity. I was told the call was very clear.
Finally, the pairing to my MacBook Pro and iPhone was very easy and switching between devices is just a matter of going the menu on the device I want use and selecting the Beats.

For the environment when I use these headphones they are exactly what I want. There tendency to slip off when bending and noise leakage make them a poor choice when I am woodworking.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I kicked around the idea of buying these after I got my iPhone X, which lacks an earphone jack. At first I didn't want to spend another couple hundred dollars after I'd just spent $1200 on the phone, but I bought these on impulse while waiting for a delayed flight last weekend. I am really happy I did. I didn't read any of the reviews until after I'd made the purchase so I was concerned for....say, 30 seconds that I'd get a fake. But let me say with absolute certainty: THESE ARE REAL. I feel bad for people who ended up with knock-offs, but I got what I paid for.

This is actually my second pair of Beats, since I've had the ""sport"" version for several years. No, those ones did not wear out - they're still going strong for four years now, but I got them to wear while training for marathons and running on the road where I wanted to be very aware of traffic and my surroundings. Since then, I've migrated more to lifting and wanted headphones that would block out outside noise and let me get into my zone uninterrupted. As a gal lifting by herself, the chatter from the ""bros"" on the weight floor is still a little intimidating to me but these Beats do just the trick to help me tune that out, pay attention to only what I am doing, but still have enough awareness of what's going on around me so that I'm not the rude one who looks like she can't share space and the equipment.

The battery life is much longer than I expected and probably does approach 40 hrs like the product description says. They came fully charged and I first used them on a Monday and think I probably didn't actually turn them off but the battery still had juice when I picked them back up on Wednesday. They are a little heavier than I expected, but still very comfortable. I am not a musician and can't weigh in on the nuances of sound quality, but I can say that my music sounds phenomenal in these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for Christmas at the behest of my son. Overall sound quality is very good, as is the battery life. Where we ran into problems is when the right side quit working after 9 months. A quick internet search revealed we were not alone with this issue. Apple support was initially happy to send them off for warranty service but quickly denied coverage for a small separation of the left side housing. Seemed trivial but Apple was firm. For $200 I think you can do better. First and last pair of Beats for us.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Been on the market for a while for a good set of Bluetooth headphones and these are by far the best set I've come across that are wireless and reasonably priced with excellent volume, bass and treble, and ease of use! With this type of product u really get what u pay for! At the sale price of $199 it's a great deal! I'm very picky about my music sources and sound quality and these instantly impressed me right out of the box! Highly recommend... It's worth the money...so happy I finally have my own ""Beats by Dre"" headset!❤👍💪💯 Don't sleep on these...super comfy too..can wear for hours without even noticing they're on!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these headphones exactly two years ago today. They now experience random disconnecting and won't repair to an already paired iDevice. At first, these were awesome! The pairing experience with an iDevice is so fluid and seamless. Pairing it to any of your other iCloud-connected devices is so easy. I went from my iPhone to my iPad to my Apple TV all in a day. The battery life is also amazing. I think I went 4 months without charging it at one point. Fast forward to today and I am really disappointed. My Solo 3s started to disconnect in the middle of songs and it wouldn't repair. I tried everything, even resetting the device and forgetting it on my iPhone. That worked at first but that solution would only last a day. I contacted Apple Support and they offered to replace it for $129 plus tax. Now that sounds like a good deal at first, but consider that I already spent $300 on these 2 years ago. I expect these headphones to last at least 5 years. And I took great care of these headphones, they were never exposed to water, and I never worked out with them (they aren't water resistant!). I think I am done with Beats, and instead, I will now take my $129 plus tax and use it towards the purchase of a Bose or Sony headphones. Hopefully, they have better build quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"After purchasing Beats Solo 3's I attempted to buy AppleCare+ at the Apple Store within the 60 day window. Apple informs me that the ""purchase date"" was more than 60 days (in fact is was 120 days prior to my purchase date). Further, trying to get a US representative is nearly impossible. Instead you are placed on hold for more than thirty minutes only to once again being connected to a off-shore representative.
AMAZON YOU HAVE GOTTEN TOO BIG FOR GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Not at all worth your $300. Seriously I would not consider purchasing these ever again, especially after the lack of support I received from Apple on them.

I purchased these originally in November of 2017. In June of 2018 I had an issue where audio stopped working completely with one of the ears (I can't remember if it was the right ear or the left ear). I brought them into the Apple Store they looked them over and determined they could be sent in. About 10 days later I received the headphones in the mail, but it was never clear if they were mine or a replacement pair that I got back (if they weren't mine, why did it take so long, why not just give me a new pair right there in the store?).

Fast forward to now, May 2019. I'm having the same exact issue. The audio in the right ear has stopped working. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps they ask you to perform (try on multiple devices, try with the cable connecting it to a device, reset the headphones, etc.). I brought them into the Apple Store, this time I'm told that my only option is to pay $129 for a replacement pair. Apple will sell you a new pair (with only a 90 day warranty) for $129 since you previously purchased this product.

Apparently the original product has a 1 year warranty on it. The replacement/repaired product has a 90 day warranty or whatever is left on your original warranty, whichever one is longer. So at this point I'm outside that window. I connected with Apple Support today, this time online, to go through the same process to see if I could find any other solutions. Same result, I can purchase the replacements for $129 which will only have a 90 day warranty on them.

So two pair of these headphones got me from November 2017 to May 2019, a total of 18 months. I'm not sure how Apple can justify that it's alright for $300 headphones to be completely worthless after a total of 18 months. Considering I had two pair, so they seem to really last roughly 9 months. I will never buy another Beats product again and I'm disappointed that I already own so many other Apple products :(.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Both my beats solo 2 and 3 stopped working between 12-18 moths. Same issue with the right earphone losing hearing without being dropped, mistreated, or abused. The first I assumed was a defect. Having it happen again, I’m convinced it’s designed with a flaw to force upgrades and stimulate purchases. Contacted apple support and after shipping both out at a cost of $130 each to repair, they refused and simply told me to purchase new ones. Poor product and even worse customer service from apple. Bought the Bose qc 3 in the hope that with spending $350, the products quality will mesh with the price better than Beats cheaply made product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these for my son in May 2018. He LOVED them until the right side quit playing. We contacted Apple since we were within the one year warranty time frame and they informed us that the serial number has been activated in December of 2017, so the warranty was already expired. Without the warranty they want 3/4 of the cost of a new pair to fix. We’re VERY upset that this is how we found out. Apple told us that sometimes other people sell returned items...which makes us out of luck.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I was hesitant to spend so much money on a pair of headphones. I've always just used the headphones that came with my iPhone. Now that the iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack in the phone, I've been looking for wireless ones so I wouldn't have to search for the little adapter. After listening to music with these headphones I realized what a difference quality headphones make. I got the glossy white and they are really pretty (which is a weird thing to say about headphones.) I'm really glad I made the investment :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I believe these are the real thing and the packaging was perfect. They paired up perfect to my ipod but I don't know if they were defective but the volume is pathetic even at full volume... I can barely hear the music but I can hear everything else! Kinda bummed because I had heard some great things about them. They're beautiful and well made but my cheap wire earbuds that I was replacing blow them away... I'm glad I kept my cheap earbuds.

Now I'll go to maybe a Bluetooth earbud or wire system... Just something that has volume so I don't hear all the noise going on when I workout. Just want to hear the music and not what the people next to me are saying. So if you want volume and music when you're working out... You don't want these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Let me start with a couple things. 1) my phone that I use these headphones with is a galaxy note 8. 2) this is my first purchase of any set of headphones that cost more than 40 dollars so high end by my standards.
With that out of the way these are not all I was expecting for such a highly known brand. I have a pair of in ear wireless headphones with what seem to me about the same sound quality and for a tenth of the price. (They are 20 bucks). These are significantly better at noise cancelling which I can appreciate. However some things I have problems with besides the quality of sound is they are tolerable to wear for a period of time with glasses but after that period they can start causing a headache and just be extremely uncomfortable. With that said they do hold secure to my head and don't really move unless I'm moving my head a lot. I've been using them on and off for 3 days now and still haven't charged them (and they came with only a half charge at that) which is incredible to me. The other problem I have is it is extremely catered to Apple I believe. When in Bluetooth mode I had a difficult time connecting even with instructions, the volume up and down/ play pause button is a hit and miss whether it wants to work or not, and trying to go back a song does not work at all. It usually just skips 3 or 4 songs ahead. When it is connected via the wire the button on the wire is useless unless I need to pause and play. The volume buttons do not work and i cannot skip or go back songs. The final problem I had is the case. It is very limited in space which I can appreciate for on the go and packing in my backpack. However getting them into it's case can be much harder than is required.
With that being said, I do actually like these headphones and will keep them. They are a good pair of headphones. The negatives I've included have primarily been the biggest problems that I've run into.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"So i thought i had something wrong with my ears but nope it's the headphones. I've been wearing all kinds of headphones for long periods of time and I've never experienced headphones that would pinch your ears and give you an ear ache that you can't rest your head on the pillow because it's too painful. I've lost sleep, work concentration and money over these. Sound quality is better than other headphones I've used but none of those $40 headphones have ever made me loose sleep. Now I can't return them after using them for one month.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I realize that these are not inexpensive headphones. I wanted really decent headphones that had a really large bass response. Beats are known for their quality and so that's what I was looking for. Fast charging that will last for a long time, meaning that I only seem to need to charge it every few days, and I use it a lot. Also very beautiful. It has invisible controls on one side of the headset, meaning that if you press one of the sides things will happen, like volume control, and most importantly, if push twice it will skip to the next song depending on how you have your source music set. I have mine set to play randomly so I don't know what is playing next. That is controlled by your unit, not the headphones. These are Bluetooth headphones and you can hook them up to anything that Bluetooth's. It also has an incredible range on it. This is my second apartment I have had them at and it actually goes perfectly from floor to floor right through the cement without sound deterioration of any kind. No I don't know what the range is, and so it may depend on your own situation, but I simply do not think that there are better headphones out there for the price. Like I said, if you are looking for excellent bass response, and I like bass, because I listen to a lot of rock 'n roll and heavy metal, then these headphones are the right ones to get. They are also very sturdy and they fold up so if need be you can put them in your coat pocket. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had these since August 2017 and I loved them but I've noticed in the last few months, they don't seem as great. I feel like some songs are fuzzy suddenly and now like tonight, they just keep, for a lack of better word, stopping; the song will stop and I'll check the connection, it is still connected and the song is playing on iTunes, but there is no sound. I'll pause the song, push the little button on the headset, then push play on iTunes and they'll be fine again for a while. And then some nights I can't get them to work at all.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"So the first thing to know about Beats is that they are optimized/equalized before you buy them. You cannot equalize Beats. That's their whole selling point is that you dont need to. Now having said that the question must be asked ""is this a good thing?"" And the answer is, to some degree at least, yes. These headphones are extremely well made and durable and the sound quality is by far the best I've heard yet. The battery life is insane. They advertise a 40 hour battery life at a full charge and up to 3 hours of battery life with just 5 minutes of charging. As far as I can tell these numbers are lower than the actual battery life as on my first full charge i didnt need to charge them for almost a month all while listening to them 4+ hours a day for at least 5 days a week. The only issue with these headphones is these are really made for rap/hip hop. Now don't get me wrong, I have listened to metal, country, pop, classic rock etc on them and it still sounds extremely good, but hardcore audiophiles may not like the inability to equalize the headphones themselves. All in all these are by far the best headphones I've ever owned and definitely are worth the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones have decent sound quality for 1) bluetooth and 2) casual listening. They are on-the-ear style that come with a 3.5mm cable (for plug-in listening and full audio quality), a nifty carrying case. What I enjoy, however, is the pairing with Apple devices via their W2 chip. I recommend these for people with Apple devices (particularly if you have more than one). If you aren't an Apple user or have a mixed ecosystem, check out Sennheiser's HD series for better options.

As they are ""on-the-ear"" phones, you may experience fatigue after several hours. By that point, giving your ears a break (for any headphones) for a few minutes will be helpful.",4.0 out of 5 stars

These are GlossBlack with look great they really are made of good materials and although it has a beautiful glossy black finish to it , its not that annoying super shiny 'sprinkling gloss'

I owned the previous model the Wired Solo 2's wich I did Enjoined but didn't fill my expectations on Quality ... The Solo 3's changes all that....
With High Quality Output Sound, Long Lasting Battery Life, and made of Great Quality materials you have everything you need in the box and the HeadPhones already come with a full charge ..... I gotta be completely Honest and say I have had them for half a day at the time of this review and wanted to write an informative review on my experience .... the quality of hd sound and battery life for daily use ... some up in One word AMAZING!!!....40 hours of battery life after a single charge or 3 hours after a 5 min. charge ...Great Quality Sound and what looks to be made of great lasting material .... Get!! I like the head phones not to mention how quickly it connects to your iPhone , now I also own an Apple Watch and was always pleased on the seamless experience of the bluetooth connectivity ...the Solo 3's give you the same experience ... giving cordless a new meaning.....

"The Basics -
Build quality: 8/10
Sound quality: 7/10
Comfort: 7/10
Battery: 10/10
Usability: 8/10

I'm going to start with the build quality, which I think is excellent. Everything from the packaging to the ear pads is looks and feels well constructed. The design of the headphones is also very simple, so there is not a lot of variation in texture/materials, which gives the headphones their slick and stylish look. The only thing I wasn't very impressed with was the soft shell carrying case, which is only okay. It's good for keeping the headphones from getting tangled or caught on stuff in a bag or pack but offers very little actual protection.

Sound quality: 7/10
For on-ear headphones, the sound quality is pretty good. But at the price point, there are other headphones you could get that have better sound quality. That being said, these definitely perform well and I enjoy listening to them.

Comfort: 7/10
As with pretty much any on-ear headphone, these do start to get uncomfortable to wear after a while. However, I find that I can wear them a good 2-3 hours before they start to get tiring on my ears. I also find that I rarely use them for that long, as when I'm at work or somewhere I'm sitting, I probably won't be using these. So they're great for traveling, around the yard or house, at school, etc, but probably not a primary headphone.

Battery: 10/10
The battery on these is amazing. I believe the battery is listed for 40 hours of use, and I would say that's about accurate. I have yet to have the battery die,

Usability: 8/10
The power button is small but easy to locate, the headphones connect super fast to my phone (almost instantly), and the play/skip and volume controls are accessible and easy to navigate without any thought.

Overall I've been super happy with these and would recommend them to any looking for a stylish and good sounding pair of school/travel headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are very good headphones, but for the steep price, I was a little disappointed. Main points:

1. SOUND QUALITY: This is the most important part of the experience and this is the downfall of the Solo3. The base is too overwhelming, resulting in an overall muddy sound. I was actually quite surprised at how bass heavy these were the moment I first turned them on. Mid range and tenor sound tight and crisp without flaws, but its simply a bit over weighed by the intense bass. Of course this is a subjective determination...but count me in in the ""this is too much bass"" group.

2. WEAR: These are a bit heavy, more so than an accompanying pair of wired headphones, but the weight in itself is not intrusive. The headphones fit tightly, but after some time the ear pads do slightly pinch my lower earlobes. Its not a deal breaker, but again, I was expecting something engineered flawlessly for comfort for the price.

3. CONNECTIVITY / BATTERY LIFE: Excellent coverage on these for blue tooth. I can walk almost up to 10 meters away in a different room before these start fritzing out. A huge plus is the very long battery life. As I listen to music at work non-stop, I was sick of having to recharge headphones every 5-6 hours or so. I charge these once and they last several days and into the weekend as well sometimes.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I recently re purchase beats solo 3 black hoping for a great experience. Out of the box everything was great and working without any issue. Travel to San Francisco didn’t have any issue. On my return trip back to my home state I experience charging issue with the beats solo 3 headphones where the battery would not take a charge and stayed on red. I tried different cables and used an ac to USB charger still same results. I stop by apple and they would have to send it out for two weeks I was still under 30 day purchase period and had them returned. I waited and purchase another pair recently hoping for a great experience worked great no issues until today. My headphone were charging all night with no issue 5 white lights. Went to the gym notice it was at 3 white light s strange. 1 hours of working out the headphones stop working. Stop by apple they said try to reset and charge again if issue continue they would send it out for service two weeks. Came to the office and attempted to reset and charge my beats solo 3. The unit would not charge pass 1 white light for 2 hours. There seems to be issue with beats solo 3 not sure what it could be but I will wait before purchasing again.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Beats are great when it comes to sound quality, mobility and battery life. The design is beautiful, they fold compactly and come with an aux cable so they can be used plugged in to things such as console controllers, monitors, laptops etc. The connectivity with my iPhone is great and the bluetooth range is impressive ( I was able to leave my phone on one floor of the house and go in to the basement and did not lose connection.) There are two down sides to these headphones however, the somewhat fragile folding system and the clamping weight. Basically you fold the headphones over on to themselves to store them and it seems like you can easily break them this way if you aren't careful. The clamping weight is the pressure these headphones put on your ears while they're on. After anywhere between 20-40 minutes of use, I usually have to take them off and readjust them to ease ear soreness. The heavy clamping weight helps these headphones stay on your ears however while moving around/exercising but unfortunately hurts your ears a lot.

Pros:
- Great mobility
- Great connectivity
- Great sound quality
- Great battery life

Cons:
- Fragile design
- Clamping weight (hurts ears over time)
- Price (if looking for budget headphones or if you don't get them on sale like I did)

Hope this review helps.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not an audiophile but husband is and currently own real great sounding headphones. I've got this ship n sold by amazon and it's 100% authentic and was able to register. We're not an apple household and I only bought this out of long time curiousity and it's battery life.
Coming from Sony and other high end brands, this beats is not really that special audio wise. The bass is good but it is too bass-y for my liking I find it annoying sometimes. It sounds great in upbeat songs because of heavy bass but too muddy and noisy in mellows. I am more into soul, jazz, classical, pop, country, acoustic, 70s 80s classics and the likes so this isn't my go to headphone. I cannot stand this headphone when it comes to slow songs. When I'm in a mood for some upbeat reggae then this is it.
It's overall nice quality, sound is good, just not $200 let alone 300 good. People saying this is the best in market probably never tried the really good ones out there (and it's okay). Glad I bought this at a deep sale price or I'd be crying by now. My $100 Sony & Bose sounds just as good and even better and clearer on most songs in my list. If we have same taste in music, look for something else, you'll find some with same sound quality but at a significantly lower price. And if you want to buy this, do yourself a favor, buy this on sale coz it's really not worth it's regular price. It's only worth $150 tops and that's already a stretch. If you've never owned expensive headphones and been saving $ to buy one then please look somewhere else: sony, bose, audioTec, bowers, beyerdynamic, sennheiser.
I'm keeping this not because of the sound but for my upcoming long international travel. I needed something that will survive me forever without charging since I'll be in the airport and plane for 2 days. The battery life is aweeesome- best out of all my bluetooth headphones!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are the real deal. Once I turned on the Bluetooth on my phone the Beats Solo software automatically appeared. It seamlessly connected to my Apple Watch as well. The Matte Black comes with grey lettering on top which also indicates that it is real. The sound is nice and crisp, especially with some old school Metallica. The headphones feel extremely comfortable, sturdy and light.

"It might seem harsh to ding the headphones for a software issue, but the reason you're paying a premium on these headphones is for the W1 chip, which makes it integrate better into the Apple ecosystem. If you're on android, there are better quality headphones for the price.

The W1 chip does let switching between apple devices work seamlessly, but the new iOS update (that I understand they have no intention of fixing) makes these completely unusable. I had to dismiss this popup 50 times a day whenever my headphones are near an iOS device. This happens on a device that's currently connected OR NOT. And when it's not, there's not even an option to connect. I have to dismiss this dialog in order to manually connect.

This is not a seamless experience. If I open my phone I want information quickly, I don't want to be reminded that my headphones exist. Do Not Disturb mode doesn't even and this misery.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Amazing headphones, I use them to do transcription and I am able to hear every single word without the strain or difficulties I had with previous headphones. The color is gorgeous and I love that it came with a case, cords and even a clip to put on the bag for when I'm traveling. The soft inner cushions for the ears are superb and very comfortable. I was worried that the white would be difficult to keep clean or would not look good but once I received them I saw that this would not be an issue. Controls on the headset are very easy to use, quick to connect to computer, laptop or cell phone and the sound quality is superb. I am very pleased with these amazing head phones and they truly are worth the splurge.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Overpriced. You can either buy for the beats name or spend half the amount of money and get something equal, if not better quality. These will break easily due to being made of cheap material. Then if you try to fix them yourself, you will need a whole set up (Soldering kit, replacement parts, and a steady hand). You’ve been warned.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Recently purchased these and have owned them for about a month. Love them and the sound quality for the most part; however, the left half of the headphones have completely blown out without warning, so now only the right side is producing sound. Very disappointed in the quality of these for the price that was paid for them. Who wants to listen to music with only sound going into one ear?",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not a headphone expert and maybe I was expecting there to be a live concert in my ears but these haven't wowed me in the slightest. The ear cups are small and can get pretty uncomfortable how they sit on your ears, the sound is just ok. Not bad but like I said, I got just as good of a sound from a less expensive pair and to top it off, they pull my hair out every time I take them off. With everything considered, I wouldn't buy them again. I'm giving them to my kids and whatever happens to them, happens. I should have stayed with my less expensive brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I really wanted these and have owned Beats Solo2 that were great. I had to return this product 3 TIMES!!! So aggravating they do not work like they used to and have failed to the point of my having to return. Lost connections and wouldn't reconnect; I have a new Iphone and it didn't work as stated in pairing; you're supposed to just open them and they automatically put a box popup on your phone where you say connect. Worked once. Then when they failed, I totally reset and went to start over totally, and no popup whatsoever. I am beginning to think Apple has done something to mess these things up since they now own the company. Anyway, cannot recommend them.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"First review, more reviews to come the longer I wear This head set.
Wore them to the gym, they did not shift in any direction while wearing them. I wear glasses, I placed then just below my upper earlobe, no year pain after an hour in the gym.
Sound was great, kept it at 3/4 volume, was just the right level to get going, but low enough to hear if someone was trying to tell me something.
Quality feels good and durable.
I have an Android phone, easy to connect to. I also have a Kindle, also a breeze to connect.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones did not disappoint. There is not one bad thing I can say about them. Great quality. Great sound. I had no problem pairing them to my iPhone and MacBook. And yes, THEY ARE AUTHENTIC. I would suggest avoiding buying them from third party sellers, I believe that is why some people are receiving knockoffs. I would also suggest avoiding buying used Beats. Buy them new if you want to be sure you receive the authentic ones. For some reason the (white and gold) Beats were $30 cheaper when I bought them... they went up in price the day after I purchased them. If you happen to see them for a great deal, don't hesitate to buy them. If you're still worried about getting a knockoff, you can always price match at Best Buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones arrived today. After wearing them off and on throughout the day, I have enjoyed their quality in materials and the sound quality is great. I was worried that they'd be heavy on bass, but they're a good balance. I've listened to several genres of music and even some podcasts and the quality is consistent throughout all areas. My only complaint is that these headphones are not comfortable to wear for extended periods. After 30-45 minutes, they start to hurt becuase they put a decent amount of pressure on my ears. This is kind of a bummer because I bought these to use while doing online classes and school work.
*update*
I was working at my computer while listening to a podcast on these headphones. I had to use the restroom, I was able to walk all the way upstairs and listen to the podcast while doing business without any interruption! The distance on these things is ridiculous!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I'll start by saying I had a hard time finding genuine Beats online, if you search online you quickly learn what to look for. These were a bit less than retail, so I wondered if I'd be getting an authentic pair. It was indeed authentic (Mickey's 90th Anniversary Solo3 Beats).

The headphones are gorgeous, they make me smile. The sound is definitely fantastic. I had heard mixed comments on the Beats sound quality, but I spent this morning switching between the Beats Solo 3 and Bose QC35 and I honestly prefer the Beats sound quality. Of course, the QC 35 have perfect noise cancellation, but the Beats never claim to be noise-cancelling.

My only complain about the Solo 3 is that they are on-ear as opposed to over the ear. This means the cushions rest directly on top of your ears and I found that they became a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours of continuous use. I don't know if I'll get used to it, or the cushions will soften/adapt more to my ears. But for prolonged listening, right now, I would prefer an over-the-ear pair.

I'm overall happy with the purchase and I think most people will be too.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"As you can see I have a variety of different pairs and these are the best sounding, most comfortable pair I own. Synced easily with my iPhone, and work perfect with my Series 1 Apple Watch music controller. I wasn't worried about the sync being an issue. They are so comfy even with my 3/4 size gauges, with them being metal it doesn't push them into my neck like some headsets do. They don't slip around either. They cover my entire ear and make a nice ""seal"" I guess you could say. Literally if they are turned up even to half the max volume I can't hear anything around me. Definitely would recommend them to anyone. I got them when they were $179 had some gift cards and such so I got a great deal on them, Amazon definitely has the best prices on these keep and eye on it if you aren't looking to drop the $300.

"Love these headphones. Great sound and easy to connect. Battery life is also exceptional. After having to replace many cheaper brands after a few months, I decided to test out these. I have had them only a month so I cannot speak to longevity but will update if that is a problem.

UPDATE- My Beats broke within a couple months internally when I just unfolded them like normal and one side doenst produce sound. I am very dissapointed because I love these things, but for $300 and they break within a year and cost half the price to repair, I reccomend to get a pair of B&o's or Bose headphone cause the sound quality is way better.

"Obsessed!! After paying full price for these as a gift for my spouse last holiday season and listening to him brag about how awesome they were, i saw the same beats solo3 on sale during prime day. These live up to the hype, especially for less than $150! I’d been using a cheaper (yet prettier) set of over the ear headphones but they would start to feel tight after a bit, didn’t have wireless/Bluetooth option, and the sound was tinny. Now i totally get the big deal about these! They’re light weight, simple to use, the sound is AMAZING, they blocked out ambient noise like a BOSS, and are so so comfortable. Feels like pillows on your ears. Highly recommend. My hubby has used them almost daily to work out in (read: sweat like crazy) and for travel and they last!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Munson bought with his money this headphones. I have use them to test, the sound is pretty good but I don’t like the fit, they feel too tight on my head and the ear caps feel to little.

If that is the case, I would rather buy another brand that will hold up. It is great the sound quality and battery life is fantastic, but if they are falling apart like this, how am I supposed to use them. Seems like a bad design.

"Pros
Amazing 40-hour battery life
Good, clear sound on iphone7 from all audio sources (music & other audio playback apps such as YouTube)
Decent call quality for user and caller (unsure of performance in noisy backgrounds or windy conditions)
Good volume range for audio playback and phone calls
Decent noise canceling ability without integration of electronic noise canceling technology (I think ear cups are manually designed for optimum noise canceling)
Cord with high-quality mic provided with headset
USB charging fcable included (able to use iPhone wall charger or other compatible USB wall charger to charge headset as well as charging from connection to PC)
Only 2 hours charging time for full battery life
Comfortable ear cup padding
Headset controls not flimsy and easy to operate
Unbroken long-range Bluetooth connectivity using iphone7
Steller support for software updates, Bluetooth connectivity, and support questions (Beats products are owned and supported by Apple company)
Easy setup and installation with iphone7 (unsure of performance with Mac or Windows PC)

Cons
Some notable trouble using headset to answer mobile calls as well as soft phone calls (skype, what's app, etc.)
Very tight fit (tight squeeze on head causing frequent headaches, though diminished a slight bit after frequent use)
No voice feedback when operating controls (battery life can only be determined by viewing indicator LEDS; troublesome for blind user)
Strangely, no headset battery indicator on iphone7 status bar (many other bluetooth headsets show battery status next to Bluetooth indicator on iPhone status bar)

Well, as you can see, I've experienced a mixed bag of positive and negatives in using this headset. Here are some additional observations based on my experience.

* Though I'm not an experienced audiofile, the bass seems full without distorting other sounds. I experienced enjoyable audio quality when watching TV apps, youtube videos, and listening to music.
* My main purpose for trying this headset was for phone call quality by comparing them with the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series. I did experience fairly clear feedback from callers when using the headset, but callers sometimes reported a bit of distortion from my end but it was only slight. Additionally, I had frequent occurrences where, after receiving a call, I could not answer with the headset when trying to use them to answer the call. Instead, the call was routed to the iPhone itself and I had to manually route the call to the headset.

An Interesting Experience to Note

However, the strangest anomaly occurred when using this headset. From reading reviews and talking with Apple support, I was told, definitively, that this headset does not have a built-in mic when being used wirelessly (accompanying cord does have built-in mic). However, I successfully used the headset using Bluetooth connection (not with cord) and callers could hear me with no trouble. So, I reasoned that if this Beats headset doesn't have a built-in mic, then my iphone7's mic is being used to communicate with callers. However, after moving over 100ft. from my iPhone, the callers could hear me as clearly as when I was less than 5ft. away from the iPhone. So, I really don't know how my voice is being transmitted to callers when I'm communicating wirelessly with this headset. hmmm!

* In addition to trouble in answering calls with this headset, my main beef with this Beats product is the really tight squeeze on my head. Unfortunately, this tightness was quite uncomfortable to the point where I dealt with several headaches. Though I've only had these for 3 weeks, the discomfort has only diminished slightly.

Frankly, because I find the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series to have superior call quality on both ends and to be much more comfortable than these, I will most likely return this headset though it consists of many good features such as seamless connectivity with the iPhone and amazingly high battery life.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"We got these on Black Friday which made them an excellent value. Overall, these headphones are very comfortable and above average from a sound quality standpoint. There are many cheaper options out there, many of which I have tried, but I think that these are really a step up. The other great thing about these was the iphone bluetooth integration which makes pairing very easy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
My first pair lasted less than a year before they started giving problems. Battery life started decreasing. Then the led on/off light wouldn't turn off so it began draining the battery. So sent it in to be repaired thru warranty company. Well they sent it back in worse condition. Headphones went dead after 3 days and would not recharge. I also found damage on the right earpiece that looks like it was preyed open with a flat head screwdriver. So I informed warranty company again and then called amazon. The rep from amazon was really cool. Said not to worry we are sending you a brand new pair instead. Love how amazon takes care of the problem better than aftermarket warranty company.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased the Beats for my daughter and she loves them. This is the second set of Solo3's I've purchased for her. The left speaker failed on each pair. I've done research on the internet and learned that Beats has a problem with the left speaker failing due to a small wire being pinched during production. Unknown if this is the problem with the Beats I've purchased. The second pair I sent back for repair and am still waiting for them to be returned. Apple/Beats needs to address this problem immediately. Amazon has been great with their fast response to assisting us with sending them back for repair, however we were told ten days. It's been longer than that. Thanks",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are...petite, I guess would describe it. They're on-ear, and even when extended fully the headband clamps them on to your head with a tenacity worthy of something from the first Alien movie. My ears can't take more than about 20 minutes before the aching and lack of blood circulation force me to take them off. Haven't encountered this with other on-ear headphones before - the first step in using headphones is actually leaving them on your head, and when that's not really possible, all other considerations pale in significance.

That said, the sound quality is OK, but not great. These sound better than previous Beats headphones, so Beats is definitely improving, but for the price, there are better sounding headphones. These headphones don't overemphasize bass as much as older Beats headphones did, but it's still a bass-heavy headphone. If you want to hear treble and mid-range, there are cheaper headphones that will deliver them more effectively.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a replacement my cheap $25 bluetooth headphones. What a world of difference. Every genre of music sounds fantastic. They are a bit heavy but you get used to the weight. The controls are on the side of the headphones and are easy to use. They pair very easily with Apple products and even with Android products. I found there was a bit of delay with the signal for Kindle HD 10 but I had that same problem with my old headphones. However, the trouble didn't last long. I wore the headphones on a long 2 mile walk and although my ears got warm they did not sweat profusely. I wouldn't use them for a hard workout though. I wish the ear cups were a bit bigger because while I was walking there was a bit of pressure on my ears. They are great for sitting at home and even some light housework. The range is decent but the signal will start to break up around 500 feet away. I would recommend an arm band for your phone or mp3 device if you would like to walk around the house with them and still have good signal. They reduce a lot of exterior noise so they could be good on an airplane or library.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Purchased these head phones under 2 years ago. They are in great condition. Very little use of the past 2 years. They stopped taking a charge months ago. Finally got around to contacting Apple support about the issue. The one year limited warranty did help Apple would not replace the defective Beats Solo headset. Very disappointed with their service and not willing to stand behind their products. Recently my son had a issue with wireless Bose headset. The covering came off due to wear. They too were about 2 years old and out of warranty. Bose support send him a shipping label and replaced the headset free of charge. I'm a Bose customer for life.

"I’m primarily comparing the beats I own to DNA monster headphones I purchased at sharper image. DNA put the beats to shame in sound quality, the quality of materials is equivalent, whereas the beats win in terms of battery.

Here is the problem; why in the world would beats be so popular if their sound quality lacks severely? My answer: Dre, and the fact that they are just cool and come in rose gold (in my case). The battery typically does last a Day, which I gotta say I love. The fact that they auto pair nicely with my phone is great too. I would recommend over-ear beats if you just have to spend the money tho, on ears do get uncomfortable. If I could do it over again, I would have lefts these overpriced headphones on the shelf.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I’ll get to the point.

Pros:

- Noise cancellation is superb. Nothing should disturb your music sessions with these on.

- Bass is adequate. Not earth shattering but good enough for a former bass head who had 10 inch subwoofers in my old Acura :-)

- Battery life is great. Didn’t have to charge these things for days.

CONS:

- Decibels could be louder. I tried these at max volume on all of my devices and was disappointed. Max volume should have your ears ringing but not the case here.

- mid range cords and vocals are lacking.

- The case requires effort to get the headphones inside. It should be effortless.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I have no complaints! Came in original box with everything as described. I’m not a headphone connoisseur and haven’t owned any others comparable to these so I can’t speak to how they measure up to others. I had been told they were of good quality so I got them, and I have enjoyed them so far. Easy to set up, and the charge lasts a long while. If you wear them for hours on end, your ears do get kind of sore, but i would expect that for any type of headphone like this. Does a pretty good job blocking out surrounding noise.

I bought these for my daughters birthday. I gave them to her yesterday. I ordered them on Amazon Prime day so the window for returning was August 18th. I assumed ( hoped) they would work directly out of the box. My daughter was so excited to get these and they don't work! One side of the headphones is silent. I am SO DISAPPOINTED and am wondering if perhaps they sent out faulty ones on Amazon Prime Day?

I have 2 pair of these and both stopped working via bluetooth after about a year. If you google beats stop working in 1 ear you will see all kinds of reviews.

"I had this unit for more than a month before returning it. Right off the bat, I didn’t like the controls being on the left side. Most people are right handed. Why put the controls on the left? Not only that but the functional layout of the controls were a little confusing. The power button (located on the right, go figure) was so tiny. I couldn’t locate the stupid thing after I had already put the headphones on. I felt like I was reading braille. I could not adjust it comfortably on my head, especially in the gym, in a good position w/o it falling every so often. I’d like to think I have a normal size head. On the plus side, the range (at least 60 ft.) and battery life (with 2/3 hrs of use per day could last a week w/o charging) was excellent.

"These headphones, like other beats products, have great quality not just in sound, but the design and everything that comes with it. The headphones are amazing to tune out from your surroundings and just jam out to whatever you like and not worry about missing a call or taking out your phone to adjust the volume or pausing your music or video. Everything is there on the left side phone to make your life easier. My only problem with these headphones is the On the ear design, Your better off getting Studio 3's if you're looking for comfortability while wearing these. Over long periods of time they start to hurt your ear and for instance, let's say you are laying in bed, u can't necessarily wear them while laying on your side, the only position u can wear them in bed is to face up. either way, these headphones are good, the only downside is to how long you can endure their uncomfortability that's all.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I’ve been rocking old school wired Bose QC’s for years (and never write product reviews). As a frequent traveler I rely heavily on my Bose Noise Cancelling “capabilities” - not something these Beats really have. That said, I paid $130 for this lil set-up on Prime Day - fantastic deal. A “whole” day into wearing them and I’ve got to say it just may have been the best $130 I’ve ever spent (heck, they could fall apart tomorrow for all I know). First, I’m really kicking myself in the butt for not going wireless sooner - I’m always snagging the wires on something and popping the wire plum out). Wireless is so liberating!!! The range on these things is incredible. I’ve got a pretty big house and I haven't found a reasonable area where the signal poops out (w/o curling up in a closet upstairs w/ my ipad in the garage). Second, the sound - crisp, clear and plenty loud. I’ve not taken them off since getting them - No doubt that’s going to agitate my wife:). Admittedly I’ve always been a Bose fanboy (not an audiophile though) and dismissed Beats all together as “just another shiny object w/ a great marketing angle”. My kids of course only wear Beats and tell me how much of an old man I look like with my wired Bose phones. Finally, battery life “if as advertised”. I’ve got about 12 hours on these guys so far which already impresses me:). The only “Cons” (it applies to most on-ear phones) are Noise in - they're not Noise Cancelling nor are they advertised to be / and Noise out - I’ve been listening to these things a fair bit louder than I do with my other headphones - when I take them off I notice how loud they are potentially to those around me (going to need to keep the volume at a reasonable setting I suppose). These things rock though - I keep finding myself dancing around the house and I’m no dancer. Get a pair, you wont regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Hoping it’s covered. I was skeptical about buying something like this on amazon.

"I've gone through a handful of over the ear headphone throughout the ears, always trying to save a few bucks. I finally splurged on these babies and it's my greatest purchase of 2019. My main use is for traveling, I can't ever sleep on planes or in airports and with these little monsters, I'm sound asleep in minutes. Half the time, I don't even put on music, I just ""activate"" the super power of noise cancelling and it's like magic. I do use them while at work and even after I've had them on for hours, they're still comfortable. For conference calls, I've noticed that the quality of input sound is much better than my airpods and I have never had any clients complain that I'm hard to hear. FIVE THUMBS and A MILLION STARS!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is fabulous. I purchased these for my husband after he kept taking mine! The most impressive feature is that they work great on your phone. I talk to clients using my beats each day and they work perfectly. Clients comment on how well they can hear me AND I can hear them crystal clear. Not only that but they are extremely comfortable whether using at the gym or for work.

Had for short time and barely used went to place on my head and plastic arm cracked. Placed back into case until returning home from trip and contacted amazon who nicely said since it was 2 days out of return period apple would warranty and nicely put me through to apple. Apple had me send back but said it was physical damage and would not cover (via a note in the return box without even contacting me). Contacted amazon again as they had requested if apple didnt help. Only response was to put me back through to apple who couldn't tell me the cost to repair and diagnosis could be 100 dollar fee(according to the note).,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Arrived when expected, arrived as expected. I'm a repeat buyer, this is my second pair of BEATS Solo3 headphones (the other one is still fine, I just keep one set in my home, and the other is for when I'm mobile/outdoors). The sound from these headphones is GREAT! They fit well and are comfortable. They're easy to connect to various devices (I've used them w/Samsung smart TV, iphones and ipad). They hold their charge for long periods and are easy to use (power button, adjust sound volume, mute button etc.). Highly recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sounds is good but the headphones are super tight on my ears. Makes my ears hurt after wearing them to long. I should have bought the over ear version. They don’t cancel noise. The phone microphone is super sensitive and doesn’t cancel out outside noise. They are good for short use. Good sound and connect easily to my iPhone. I think Apple could have done a better job implementing more technology and comfort to these headphones. But then again they haven’t perfected the iPods, which I love but they need to fit in my ear better.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"love the sound, earcups get warm on ears. Biggest disappointment is the ear tap control.......totally worthless.

"Bought this product twice. Once in 2017 and again in 2019. The first pair fell started falling apart after 3 months (headphone material). The second pair lasted a few days over the 1 year mark and although this time they didn’t fall apart the power LED won’t shut off.

I tried all the different methods on their site and what others suggested doing, but nothing worked. I contacted beats support and they said I was out of the limited service warranty period so I would need to pay $129 to have them fixed or replaced.

I bought my first pair at $200+ and the second pair at $150 and now they want another $129 to fix a problem that seems to be an ongoing issue with their product due to poor construction. Aside from that, they sound good, which is why I feel inclined to give 2 stars, but based on my experience with these headphones that’s as much as I’m willing to rate it due to poor construction and warranty services.

If you’re going to buys these make sure to get an extended warranty or purchase them at Apple with AppleCare.",2.0 out of 5 stars
My son got these for his birthday. He loves them so much! He always has them on his head and loves the wireless feature. He can have his phone at one end of the house and go all the way to the other end of the house and it is still connected. He had an issue setting it up. You hit the button for 1 second for apple phones and 5 for android. The battery last a long time. He normally charges it at night but it last all day and isn't dead at night when he goes to charge it. The sound is incredible and it is so soft and light weight on the ears and head. I would defiantly recommend these to anyone or any age that loves listening to music or watching movies on tablets/phones.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The reason why I'm giving 3 stars is because the Apple support is great and they are arranging to give me a repaired unit soon, the sound quality is really good as well, and the battery life is crazy long.
I have used these headphone really not even 6 months of regular usage, I have not really over used them, I mainly had them on the pouch, but still, in less than a year they ended up looking like in the pictures below.
I am not sure at this point if this was faulty unit from the manufacturer or who knows what.
I never dropped the headphones, never use them while on the gym, to be in contact with water, but still.
The product on the sound aspect, has an amazing texture of base, lows, it really makes you immerse on the sound itself, I just wish this wouldn't happen. Hope this helps, as many other experiences might not be the same as mine.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this back in July I got the matt black.

I love mine so much I decided to buy our daughter a set for Christmas. Iv used them for a couple of years. The sound is perfect pitch. They're easy hook up and use each and every time you use them.

"I had to say I took a huge risk lol i saw a bunch of negative comments I was like should I get them or not. I don’t know about the other customers, but I got my Beats and I am happy with them. Real deal not Fake atleast mines were real and I got the satin gold and not “Jason’s” old headphones or bose whatever brand that headphones are. Just take care of them. I feel like most of the picture up there are for attention. None of them did an unboxing video from the beginning, its a bunch of photos. Anyone can say its fake. I will tell you this if it did not have shrink wrap on it send it back. I got new ones my cords and Accessories were in the box my beat sticker it look like it was straight from apple.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I generally like Beats headsets. The sound quality is great and they are elegantly constructed. This is the second Beats product I bought. The first one (Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphone) broke at the hinge after two years of daily, but careful use. I replaced them with the Beats Solo3, but they lasted exactly a year and six months before one of the speakers became intermittent and eventually stopped working completely.

Beats headsets are expensive. I don't mind paying for quality, but I this will be the last Beats headset I purchase.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I won’t buy Beats merchandise ever again. The power button to operate the wireless function on these headphones quit working within a year and a few months of purchasing. Amazon would not stand behind a replacement.
I was told to call the 800 number for Beats, and they were not helpful either. They will not replace since the headphones are only 5 months past warranty. They should last longer than 12 months because they are not an inexpensive pair of headphones. Very disappointing. Don't purchase this product unless you want to lose over $200.00.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased two pairs of these as a Deal of the Day, but they are really just a Trick of the Day. Of course I saved them for a Christmas gift, months past and I never knew it was faulty. I gift one to my son, and the other to my 14 year old nephew. He was so excited .... but d*** only one side worked. I mean you want to look cool as a teenager but only one side?? What a waste of money. Its like they almost know in advance that you'll be stupid enough to hide these away long enough that the super short 30 day return period passes. And don't bother calling about how they don't work. They will just tell you that they can't help you or to call the manufacturer. Likely as not these are second rate and thus the deal. Remeber that in life nothing is this good; unless its broke.

So it will stare at you from its crisp looking box. Just not working... and you threw your $$ at it. Like a sucker.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Everyone. Please do not buy any product from Beats. All beats products are made from China from really cheap materials and other things in the making of the product. So they are sold here in the U.S for an exaggerated high amount price, and it’s a big profit for the Beats company. Don’t fall into just the brand and it’s marketing strategies. Would you rather look for well-known brand or for quality headphones, proven to work and perform outstandingly? And these other outstanding products are even cheaper than Beats. Why, because the price for Beats is an unreasonable price. The Beats are not worth that price because it’s made with cheap materials. Always research first and read reviews. I was actually in Best Buy today and they told me that Beats are the worst earphones you can buy because of how cheap they’re made. Best Buy themselves even have countless statistics and proofs that the earphone they sell are legit and actually work.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Had a pair of Beats a few years ago and loved them. Bought these on Prime day for half off and as usual are my favority headphones once again. Very long battery and overall great sound.

"Earpieces are falling apart. This was an absolutely joke of a product to buy. They're not being worn for working out or any activity that would warrant the earpieces to fall off of the headphone.

"Got these for Mothers day last year. Started wearing them in January on a daily basis. They only lasted 4 months and then they would no longer turn on. Said theynm had a full charge but would never turn on again. Waited a few days and kept trying them. Called Apple to have them repaired and got nothing but horrible customer service. Apple just lost another fan. If they can't stand behind their products or at least build something that works longer than 4 months, they are no better than their Chinese Knock-offs. My husband bought a similar wireless pair on Amazon for $29 and they sound the same but have lasted him the entire time he has owned them with no issue. He just ordered me a pair. Could have bought 8 pair for the price of these crappy beats.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Not a knockoff.
These are the best sounding pair of headphones I’ve ever owned, and the decision to purchase was not taken lightly because of the cost. Sound quality is amazing. I’m hearing lyrics I’ve never heard before.

The ONLY downside to these is comfort. They’re fine if I’m wearing them for only an hour at a time, but any longer than that and my ears start to hurt because of the pressure. It almost makes me want to consider saving up for a pair of over-the-ear Studios.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I take care of all the electronics I own. I've gone through maybe ten or fifteen pairs of earbuds so far. These beats aren't those earbuds, and they aren't like many headsets

This is a stupidly comfortable over ear headset with the sound and design to match its Apple product cost. It has lasted me seven months without any sign of trouble. It is sturdy, easily collapsible, and a fast charge for the one or two week charge you could get out of it, even with playing music everyday. Its bluetooth connection is crystal clear and easy to configure most of the time.

However, I am a six foot adult male with a big head. I should've gone with the Beats Studio 3 since its a much larger design for a little bit more money. I don't even remember how I broke the bands on the sided of the headset, though I'm keeping them together via tape. The cost to repair the headset IN APPLE STORE STYLE costs as much as the headset, which is ridiculous. Thankfully, my beats are still fully functioning, and I plan on buying another headset when I have the money.",4.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are great if you can get them to connect to your iPhone. It takes about 15-30 minutes every time you want to get them to connect to your Bluetooth. I’ve tried everything. My headphones power button will be flashing and my iPhone will be searching and nothing happens. You just have to keep powering off the headphones and turn them back on to flashing or keep shutting your phone off and turning it back on. The 15th time of doing a combination of those things will eventually work and it will connect.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"I like these headphones because they look nice and the sound is pretty good. Unfortunately, after about an hour of wearing them, they start to hurt my ears and the sides of my head.

Love the product however it had to be replaced because it would not charge correctly. Luckily the year warranty covered it. This is the second pair I have had. The first pair has one headphone that no longer works and it wasn’t under warranty so I am stuck paying $150.00 to get it fixed. Therefore I bought a extended warranty for the the current pair. After paying over $300 for each pair I think they should last longer without having functional issues!,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I work with a lot of virtual conference calls. I had a Jabra provided through work, but couldn't pass up the prime day deal. The wireless microphone in the headset is fantastic. Very important to mute as it will pick up quite a bit.

Connects with ease to all my devices--iphone, bluetooth dongle on desktop pc, work lenovo laptop.

I seem to only have to charge once per week. I was torn between this set and a bose set. I don't regret my choice.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I got these headphones to replace a Phillips brand that more than exceeded my expectations for the price I paid. I chose Beats brand because of their quality reputation and was really excited for their noise cancellation ability. While the unboxing was impressive and I enjoyed a full charge at arrival, these offer absolutely no noise cancellation as advertised. I bought two pair: one for myself and one for my kiddo. For the price I paid, I am extremely disappointed.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased these to finally go wireless with less ports on my work machine than before and I got to use these for about 6 months before they stopped charging completely, rendering them useless as wireless headphones.

They’re very pretty, and the folding aspect with the case is clever. The wire for using them as wired is nice but, if I wanted wired headphones I wouldn’t have paid an extra $100 for these.

Additionally, it’s worth noting that you should be aware of the size of your head. I wear glasses and found these very uncomfortable to wear after an hour or two because they pushed the arms of the glasses into the sides of my head. I could get around it by pushing the arms of my glasses over the ear cushion but this obviously messed with my astigmatism prescription.

The charging problem is not a one-off thing. Do a web search and see that many people have needed to fix this and it involves cutting open the headphone to rewrite it yourself.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these because they were on sale for $140 that day. That’s a decent price for them. I wouldn’t pay much more though. They are a little tight and pinch my ears after awhile—my head is not huge.

NOTE: the studio version has noise cancellation, the solo version does not. I bought these bc they were cheaper and the noise cancellation function gives me motion sickness.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"My fiancé gifted these to me for Christmas to replace my old Beats which were not wireless.

I love these so much! The color is beautiful and actually matches my hair. Sometimes my family tries talking to me not realizing I can’t hear.

I highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones were terrible! When the box arrived, it was not completely sealed. It looked as if it had been previously opened. Also, the zipper to the carrying case that comes with it was broken.

After using it only 4 times, and within the first week of owning them, the material broke away from the plastic on the right side air phones as shown in the picture. Also, the headphones plastic cracked and split open and the backing to the auxiliary device mic fell off and wouldn’t click back on. I question the authenticity of this product. I feel like I purchased a knock off sent to me in an original box. Not happy. Returning them.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I will admit I am a long-time review lurker, but never actually post reviews here because I'm lazy. However, I felt as if I should give an honest review for these, as the holiday season is approaching.

I'm a HUGE music guy and have had a pair of Beats and every On-Ear model since they first rolled out. My Solo 2 wired in headphones got stolen out of my luggage and I recently got the iPhone 8, so I figured it was finally time to venture into the ""Wireless"" territory. I purchased the Solo 3 Wireless Gloss Black pair back at the end of September and everything came as expected and they looked awesome.

However, after 45 min at the gym and them being fully charged, they just turned off and would not power back on. I tried numerous Youtube videos of resetting them and charging them, but nothing. I chatted with an Apple associate and ended up bringing them in to the Genius Bar and even they were baffled at what was going on. I sent them in for repair and got them back a few days later and after one use the same issue occurred.

I then went to the Apple store again and we looked at everything, software on my phone, the headphones, etc, and they were still baffled. I sent them in again and they sent me a new pair. This new pair worked well, but would not power off (light always flashing) and also would not charge at all. Maybe it was just the Gloss Black style? I don't know.

Finally, after about a month of frustration, I sent them back to Amazon and searched forever on Amazon for a new pair of great wireless headphones (since I used gift cards to buy this), but could not find anything that had the fashion, fit and sound that I liked from my Beats.

As a loyal Beats fan, I insanely purchased a new pair of the regular Black Solo 3 Wirless beats and so far everything has been working amazingly, the sound is awesome, the battery life is insane and they fit perfectly for when I'm going running.

Moral of the story is these headphones are really great, but like they always say, ""third time was a charm"" and the whole process of getting there was a bit frustrating. Therefore, I caution on the side of buying any warranty on these, as all of my costs were taken care of and I didn't spend a penny extra.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm a headphone enthusiast and I love these headphones. I have Sennheiser 600HD's, amped, in ear monitors, in ear Bose headphones, and about 4 other cans.

I would say these are ""Fun"". They don't have a huge sound stage, but you can't expect a huge soundstage from on ear headphones. They sound great for Bluetooth headphones and they feel comfortable.

I originally bought these for use in the gym since I workout 6-7 days a week but honestly I sweat way too much and these only make it worse. If you're a sweater then don't get these on ear headphones, you'll be miserable, you'd probably be better off with the in ear power beats.

I give these 5 stars though because they just sound fantastic. And they have a 40 hour battery life. That's just wild to me. They are the best (or should I say the funnest?) Bluetooth headphones I've tried out so far and I tried out quite a few before buying these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Ok so I’m a really picky person when it comes to headphones, I have gone through jbl, skullcandy, Apple. You get the point, I’ve been through a ton of headphones, but these ones have satisfied me the most. Alright to my review, bass: bass is alright I’d say, enough to satisfy me, not to much not to less, I will be honest when this is at max volume, it will shake your head hard, but if you can’t handle that volume I do not recommend. Sound quality: this is what I love about them the most, their sound quality is litteraly crystal clear. absolutely recommended if you just want to hear every detail of the music and video that you are watching. Comfort: the insides are made of memory foam which is really soft when worn in warm temperatures, which is really good, the top part has padding. but when in a cold temperature it gets really hard and uncomfortable, so if your looking for headphones for a cold climate, I do not recommend these, I have a couple of friends who absolutely destroyed their headphones, like torn the leather from the headphones, but to prevent that, keep it in a case at all times you are not using it, don’t leave it on the floor, on a desk, basically anywhere without its case(provided). Noise cancellation: their is some to no noise cancellation on these headphones, so if your in a loud environment your going to hear it. Noise leakage: I have tested these in a quiet environment and no one will here you, ok if it is at like max they can here it but it’s like a whisper(friend told me). So if your looking to listen to this in like a library, these absolutely for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones were a splurge for me but turned out to be an expensive disappointment. Wireless solo3 right side stopped working after warranty expired. Took great care in keeping these headphones pristine and even bought an additional matching case. Fees to repair start at $130 with $7 shipping just to look at them. Waste of money and won’t be replacing them with Beats. I can buy better ones from other companies for less than the cost to repair or replace.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I reeeeeally wanted to like this. I have another brand already and heard my sister's Beat. I decided to get myself one. The sound quality does not justify the price. It is not far from the $37.00 wireless unit I have, but fine I was going to keep it anyways. Then the biggest obstacle was the functionality. On my headphones, I can easily maneuver back, forth and sound up and down. The Beats did not seem to have the feature. Nothing other than power on and off. I am rather computer savvy but could not make it work. Back to the MPOW unit. It functions better for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First off the connectivity of these is great. I was two floors above my phone and they performed like normal! I am an Apple user so that might be why it's so good. These are super comfortable and they fit my head super well! The battery life is no joke too, I charged them too 93 percent used them the entire day checked the battery and there was still 87 percent left! Once you put these on at about 5 or 6 volume everything else fades out. The controls on these are also super helpful. You can adjust the volume, activate Siri, pause songs (works with Spotify) and pick up and hang up calls, I mean what else could you want. These look super sleek on your head. I recommend the matte black because then they don't take fingerprints and scratches easily. One other thing is the mic. It might just be me but there is a slight echo so you can hear what you are saying. Everyone that I've called says that I sound great! In conclusion, these are a great pair of headphones and they are totally worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These stopped working on one side; the leather started coming off! We

My wife uses these every time she goes to the gym - this is the first pair of expensive headphones that she is actually willing to use. Great battery life and works flawlessly with her iPhone. She is very pleased with the sound quality and it does a great job playing that hideous hip hop crap she listens to. Other reviews are luke-warm on this model but I can't agree with them - it's great value for money.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"it s the first time purchase an on-ear headphones so can not compare with other products. I have it for around 2 months now, sound quality is a bit above average, It has plenty of bass. like other Beats products, quality looks good. The battery life amazed me, 1 hour charge and I use it for 4-5 days, 10hrs/day. The range is pretty far, more than 50 yards I still have good connection. The only thing bothers me is that it hurts my ears after around 1 hour of using. I tried to stretch it by put it over a few book, then use hair dryer to heat it up, leave it over night. It helps quite a lot.",4.0 out of 5 stars

So, about 2 months after purchasing them the cover on the ear portion began to come apart. The thread just started to unthread and now you can see the cushion part of the ear. He doesn't even use them anymore. I am very disappointed as these headphones are not cheap and this was his graduation present for getting his Masters!",1.0 out of 5 stars
I got these for a trip and I still love them. They work very well and match my phone. They have a case so I can keep the cord and charger all together. They are adjustable and easy to set up. Noise quality is really great. These are not noise canceling ones but they block out noise well. They turn off in MN cold if you do Bluetooth but work just fine with the cord. There are many color options too.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The biggest quality these headphones have is by far how convenient they are and how easily they connect to an iPhone. They also look very good and the sound quality on these headphones is all right as long as you aren't expecting too much. The controls are also subtle and easy to reach.
However, I cannot recommend this product. The biggest problem with them is how fragile they are. After only six months of casual use, substantial damage is visible. Particularly on the headband, which lacks cushioning and tears very quickly. The other problem is the price. You can find headphones that accomplish the same job for about half the price when looking at brands like Sennheiser or AudioTechnica.
This product seems to be aimed at younger people looking for good looking and convenient headphones. I recommend that you save your money and look elsewhere for headphones that look just as good, sound just as good and are far cheaper.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Birthday present for my 15 year old, he absolutely loves them. I tried them myself and the sound quality is amazing. Couple of quick points:
1. do not have the audio cable plugged in when trying to turn on or setup Bluetooth. The cable needs to be left out in order to do that.
2. if you do use the audio cable, the 90 degree elbow end goes into the audio device and the straight end goes into the headphones. otherwise you will only get sound out of one side.
We had a couple issues initially, but that is only because we didn't follow the above two points. After figuring those out, the headphones work great. Great sound and decent comfort. Easy to setup.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I am constantly wearing headphones and wanted to switch it up by getting a pair of over the ear wireless headphones. I've been looking into getting Beats for a while and was excited to try these out!

1. I love the look of them! Thought I'd look hideous in over the ear wireless headphones but they're super cute and look great.

2. I love the optional cord to plug into devices (not the charger). Provides a nice option if you want to use that!

3. They're kind of comfy. Not the most comfortable I've ever experienced but decent. Maybe it adds to a little discomfort with the fact that I have multiple ear piercings that perhaps are a little smushed with these style of headphones.

4. The sound quality is AWESOME! So great.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"First off let me say that when they are not broken, they are excellent headphones. Sound quality, battery life, range, all of that is great. The problem is they are not durable at all. The first pair I owned, I had to send back to the manufacturer after 6 months due to the battery that all of a sudden stopped charging. It was under warranty so they were replaced. 9 months later the right headphone stopped working but because it was past their 1 year limited warranty (from purchase date) there wasn't anything I could do. I ended up giving them a second chance and buying a second pair, which lasted a little over a year until one side of the headphones (they are expandable) came clean off the headset. For $250 dollars I expect them to last longer than a year. I would suggest going with a different companies product unless you are comfortable replacing these every 12-18 months. All in all its been 28 months since I bought my first pair and now I need to buy a third set of headphones, it will not be from Beats.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Broke after a year. Nothing weird, just wouldn’t turn on one day. Sent them into apple for 130$ for service. After hours of dealing with the service department, they told me I “made product modifications” and they won’t fix them for the 130. These have never left the office. Essentially was accused of being some sort of bedroom hacker with my headphones? Stunningly ridiculous. They told me they’d fix them for $369. Not sure if they’re aware how much they are new? The whole experience is insulting, I won’t be buying more beats products.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I loved this product and gifted it to my wife for her birthday. Its been 5 months and she has barely used these. In the starting she mentioned that it gives her pain in the ear lobes, but i said may be she is not used to headphones so it takes time adjusting. Now she started back and has got a permanent pain in the lobes that hurts her in her day to day activities specifically sleeping as the ears touch he pillow. She has stopped using it now and this product is a waste for me. I want to return it back and need my refund but amazon will not entertain it now. It has created medical issues for my wife and the product is still almost new here. I invested money here and i m really really disappointed with the quality.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Full disclosure. I am an MPow guy that is very satisfied with the quality over my wireless headset. That said, I could not pass up on the deal during Amazon Prime Day. I got this headset for 55% off normal cost and have not been disappointed with my purchase. Very impressed by this headset. Mind you, I was the guy that would never spend $300+ on a pair of premium wireless headphones. At $146 you can't go wrong. ;)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these over three years ago and use mostly for travel and when I'm walking.
Had to take them to get replaced a little over a year ago because they stopped holding a charge and apple replaced when they could not repair. Well now the same thing is happening with the replacement. Couldn't get 2 years out of either head phone and since the one I have is a replacement no further warranty.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Really disappointed. When my wife first used these, running outdoors, they only lasted 5 minutes then shut down. She fully charged and tried again and once again, they stopped working after 5 minutes. Amazon replaced and the new pair is doing the same thing. I thought I was buying top-of-the-line equipment. By the way, the sound is good until they shut down. Honestly, I wouldn't buy these if you live up north where the outdoor temperature falls below 32 degrees.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Great product, until it stops working. 7 months use and no sound out of one side. Ear pads are also ripping away from frame and just look like material is crumbling.
Still under warranty, so we will see the fix they offer. Will update. At this point, not worth the price we paid, wouldn't buy again.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Shockingly poor quality materials and subpar construction for a premium priced product from Beats (and Apple). The sound is solid - although they should get louder in my opinion - but after just a handful of months of ""light use"" they are literally falling apart. There are two places where the adhesive has worn off and the components are separating from each other. Keep in mind, I'm not some punk kid who doesn't care for his stuff, I'm a 40-year-old man who absolutely babies my electronics!",1.0 out of 5 stars
The first Beats Solo3 received did not work. They would not go wireless nor would they fully work while plugged in. They had many issues. Amazon immediately sent a replacement as I packaged and sent the return item. The replacement head phones were as expected and worked great! My son has enjoyed hours of listening time in the few days he has had them. The battery is amazing and he loves the sound and feel of the headphones. A definite recommend.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I like this product very much. I have to say when I saw the packaging it made me realize how high the standards were. The unboxing experience was top notch and couldn’t ask for better. The first thing I notice when I put these headphones on was that the earmuffs were really soft and comfortable. Then I paired these up to my iPhone and I couldn’t even imagine the simplicity apple has created to pair these beats to a device. Next I played some music. It was very high quality and they were better than any of the headphones I’ve had before, the highs and lows were very balanced. And do not worry about these being counterfeit because I was worried when I purchased them but when I paired the beats there was proof of the W1 chip because of the simple pairing. The battery life on this is also remarkable I didn’t have to charge these for weeks till they were dead. Overall I really recommend picking these up, bye and I hope u like your beats. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these Beats headphones because they were on sale, and because I thought ""It's been a while since I had beats, maybe I should give them a second chance."" I should not have. I may be biased since I own high quality headphones, I have Bose QuietComfort 35ii and Sony WH-1000XM3s. I was expecting sound quality maybe just slightly below these with no active noise canceling since they were just on-ear and what I got was far below my expectations.

Sound Quality: 2/5
By no means are these the worse headphones I've ever listened to, but they are the worst headphones I have ever listened to at this price point. The trebles are just meh and that's the best part of these headphones. The mids sound like you're listening to someone else's party down the street or you're listening to someone else's music through a wall. It's atrociously bad and this is the worst part of the headphone. The bass is actually okay... until you have both bass and another range of sound playing at the same time. The bass quality is nice, and these really boost bass but you sacrifice washing out the rest of the song into a muddle mess and hearing nothing but slapping bass. This is fine, if you're a basshead and these headphones are GREAT when I'm listening to a bass-heavy rap song or EDM, but when I want to listen to anything else they're pretty trash.

Appearance: 3/5
These are beats and they look more like a fashion statement than any real headphones. Audiophiles will smirk as you pass by them because they know you paid way more than these are actually worth.

Comfort: 1/5
The clamping force is too hard for anyone to wear comfortably especially compared to what else is on the market for this price point. On top of that the materials used are super uncomfortable. The rubber headband pulls on your hair (and mine's short, I'm in the Marine Corps), the ear cups are stiff and made of some type of pleather probably, and after a half hour of wearing them (ONLY A HALF HOUR!!) I don't want to continue listening to these headphones since they push on my ears uncomfortably, grip my head and pull my hair (I'm not that into BDSM, thank you).

Ease of Access (iOS): 3/5
Ease of Access (everything else): 1/5

Connecting to an iPhone or iPad is a breeze, just turn the headphones on and bam you're connected for the most part. Sometimes it's a little finnicky. In comparison, the airpods have a much smaller form factor, better latency and better range.

Connecting to any other device is like trying to fight your mom; you'll probably win, but is it worth it? Definitely not. These will connect to your other devices, but in order to stop it from connecting to my iPad even when I had told my iPad to forget these headphones I had to take my iPad to another room and turn on these headphones outside with the device I wanted. Definitely cumbersome.

For full price of $299.99 these are just not worth it. Even for the discounted price of $160, they just aren't worth it.
Amazon has plenty of other well-priced headphones on the market...

For bassheads: Skullcandy Crusher Wireless ($120)
For flat EQ but good sound: Bose QuietComfort 35ii ($350)
For the best acoustic sound: Sony WH-1000XM3 ($350)
Best sound on a budget: Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (on sale for $130, but usually $150)

In summary, if you want convenient iOS headphones, just buy the airpods. If this is you're first time venturing into the expensive headphone market, I hope this review helped you move away from these headphones. I really don't know who these are for except people who were previously fans of the Beats line. If anything though, I think their sound quality has further degraded from when Beats was partnered with monster headphones. I hope this review helped!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are AWESOME! As a Mom, I am typically not a “name brand” kind of person. These were a gift from my husband and really a splurge, but I absolutely love them. Doing laundry, dishes, and other housework is much more enjoyable listening to music and these do not fall off my head like other headphones and earbuds I have owned in the past. So any Moms out there who aren’t sure about these, just go ahead and make the purchase. High quality, easy to connect, and well worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"love my headphones and if it gets soiled, I use a wipe or a damp soapy rag to clean it and it is a good as new. It cancels out everything and the battery life is as promised, I listened to my books when I’m cleaning the house, running errands, and doing choirs and I’m never worried that the battery is going to fail me. For how I use it you would think I would have to charge it daily, but I don’t. It’s a great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is my second pair of Beats and both stopped functioning after about 18 months. My last pair would not turn off. I did a factory reset that worked but now it won’t turn on. I’ve tried every trick known to the Internet to no avail. Beats updater says that my firmware is up to date and that my Beats are functioning. Obviously not. On a good note, the battery life and sound quality are both great.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I loved them for everything except for comfort. After less than 30 minutes, I continually had bad ear and jaw pain. I could feel my ears throbbing while wearing them. I tried moving them around and stretching them out to no success, so I'll be returning them.
I'm definitely a believer in everything else about them, so I hope they make future iterations that'll work for me!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I like the sound quality, the lightness, and I’m pleasantly surprised by the comfort level. I have previously owned Beats Solo 2’s Wireless and they did hurt my ears after wearing them awhile. I’ve worn these for hours straight with no issues. The bass is sufficient and the Bluetooth connection with my iPhone is flawless! I’d say these were a great purchase at 129 dollars during the recent Cyber Monday event.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are HORRIBLE! I have gotten 2 different pairs for my fiancé. Both pairs will not hold a charge. When they do charge, the die very quickly. Disconnect from phone for no reason. Cannot even get to turn on anymore when they are fully charged. These are a waste of money and should be fraud for what the represent compare to what they provide to you. Two different pairs have done the same thing. It's the product in general. bad quality. Do not waste your money on these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros:
1- looks amazing
2- Loud sound
3- fair bass

Cons:
1- No Next/Previous track buttons.
2- Ears get too hot at gym because of the leather. I would really prefer if they made another sport line that contains cushion instead.

Concentrate on the performance & comfort. The only difference between Solo 2 & 3 is battery which doesn’t make sense",3.0 out of 5 stars
If you are a bass hunter or like dubstep this is for you otherwise look for better quality headphones low range is non existent or muffled and medium is there but super heavy on bass and the wireless works well but not long range enough the earpads are the same from other models so they will ware out better to buy replacements now or higher quality ones. You are buying the name not good headphones. Decent battery life.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"My nephews wanted these, and they love them. They sound okay to me, but I'd honestly look elsewhere if you want a high-quality, comfortable pair of headphones.

The bluetooth and battery life are the real pluses on these. The battery lasts forever, they charge pretty quickly, and the bluetooth has a really good range. The sound tends to be a bit bass-heavy and possibly muddy, and I don't know how comfortable they would be over a long session. I tried them out only for a few minutes and could only go off of my immediate impressions.

Depending on your genre preferences, these may be suitable. For me, I would look elsewhere.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I went through every process detailed to check whether they were real or not after I got them on a too-good-to-be-true Prime Day deal. From everything I can tell they are, and they register with the Beats Software Updater.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones sound really good like other beats headphones I have had. The problem with these headphones is how uncomfortable they are. If you are only using them for 30 minutes or so they are just fine. Anything more than that your ears will start hurting more and more. I don't know why they went with on ear headphones pads instead of over ear headphones. The studio headphones I have are over ear and they can be worn for hours without any discomfort.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I really enjoy the convenience of these wireless headphones. They're easy to use and fit comfortably over my ears. They're not too heavy, which I was concerned about because I plan to run in them, and the collapsible arms are helpful for storage. In terms of sound quality, I don't feel that they're especially better than other good quality headphones, but they're good. The sound quality certainly isn't compromised at all. Whether intentional or not, they do have some noise cancellation effect also which I appreciate. Overall, pleased with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"The problem with this product is not the quality but the user unfriendliness of it’s design.
You don’t even know if it’s off or on, because there is no signal... either the design is flawed or the product I received is defective.
Having some kind light that indicates it’s on will help... per the user manual it says the fuel gauge will light white... the product I got only shows the lights when it’s only plugged to usb...",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I just ordered and received these headphones today (same day delivery with Prime). I'll start by saying they are authentic Beats (Fulfilled by Amazon). I purchased the protection plan just in case. That being said, i'm listening to music with these headphones as I write this review, and they are perfect.

They'll be gym tested tomorrow, but based on the fit, I don't anticipate any issues. A great first impression.

Build: 4 - Lightweight and sturdy construction
Comfort: 5 - Snug fit...stays on my head, and they fit comfortably
Sound 5 - The sound is great. I'm no audio expert, but it offers deep, rich sounds",5.0 out of 5 stars
My granddaughter loved them. She plays the piano and can hook them up to her keyboard and listen to songs as she plays them back on the piano without bothering the rest of her family. The sound seems to be awesome and it was just the pick of Christmas. I bought a blue pair for her brother and he loves his as well. His were the Solo2 and there is not a lot of difference between the Solo2 or the Solo3...,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Bingo! As an older fella I haven’t been impressed with all the young studs walking around with these but, in desperation, I ordered a pair and have never looked back. I like them. They sound terrific and young beautiful women are walking past me without noticing a darned thing. Battery life? I’ve had them for a month now and STILL haven’t used the charging cable.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is amazing and I love it, but only use it for less than 2 months and the sound is not playing in the right ear. I expected a higher quality especially since this is not a cheap headset. I expected more from beats, my husband have the pro and my son the solo. This solo3 is the only one not working. I'm very disappointed and sad since I really enjoyed it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I order the headphones thinking they would do me justice on my deployment in Kuwait but I was wrong like way wrong. The first month they were perfect in every aspect of the word but out of nowhere one side went out and would barely work since. Two more months passed and then they just stopped working all together and since the warranty was with a 3rd party it just left me with broken headphones in the middle of my deployment. I will never buy anything like this from amazon again and amazon was my trusted source till now. So be careful what you buy and trust and believe these are trash.,1.0 out of 5 stars
90 days after purchasing the material began to tear away from the head piece. I took it to the Apple store and they replaced them only to have it happen within 90 days again. Warranty is now up and I refuse to order another pair or pay for them to be fixed. The quality does NOT justify the price and I’ll NEVER order another pair.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Power button stopped working after a little over a year, which after some extensive googling seems to be a very common problem with beats headphones. They were decent quality in terms of audio, not completely sound cancelling, but I liked them. If I’m honest I bought them mainly for their battery life and their appearance. Sad to have lost them, which I guess indicates something in their favor. But angry enough not to want to buy them again.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"They sound really good. I haven't tested a bunch of brands, but I know Beats get really good reviews. The only reason I don't give them five stars is this: After about 8 months of use, these wireless headphones are starting to do what my wired Beats did -- the foam is starting to peel away on the ears. It's not the end of the world....I'll probably order some replacements when they come all the way off. But this issue keeps them from being a five-star product.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"It’s a bit base heavy, as it is designed to do, but I feel my music sounds so much better with it streaming from my iPhone.

"Was looking to upgrade from my original solo’s and I’m incredibly pleased with the Solo3’s. These headphones are so aesthetically pleasing! I got the Satin Silver color and I am so happy with how crisp they look. These are more comfortable than the original Solos and seem to be constructed in a more solid manner (I threw in a picture of my old white Solos for comparison, which might I add lasted me SEVEN years without trouble, hoping for the same longevity with the Solo3’s). The Solo3’s sound awesome and the pairing capabilities are lightining fast due to the w1 chip that allows for speedy pairing with Apple devices. I will update once I’ve had these headphones for longer to report on their durability and battery life. Extremely happy with my purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Item was listed as “NEW”. I received it and it wasn’t sealed, had greasy finger prints all over the headset, there was a beat up LG charger to replace the original one, the case was missing, and the instructions were missing as well.

These headphones are really nice. The bass isn't too crazy but enough where it doesn't disort it. The sound overall is pretty decent. They connect easy and have impressive battery life. They last about 2 days without disconnecting them once. I would recommend these but make sure you read the specs before you buy if your looking for super loud bass headphones,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I love this headphones, they connect so easy to any device, ipad, TV, phone, and the sound is just amazing. I wanted this headphones because I've been doing binural meditation and I wanted to cancel any noise. I don't like having anything inside my ear and the tiny succion headphones create some king of pressure on my ears, instead of meditating I keep focusing on how my ears feel. I got my headphones on sale and although I wanted another color (whcih was not on sale) they are woth the price!! Best of all is that I can watch tv late without bodering anybody.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Much, much too expensive for what you get. My 11 yr old son insisted on these because of the brand name. The sound quality and build quality aren't nearly as good as what you get for this price from Bose, Sennheiser or Grado. The plastic circle behind the driver pops off every week or two because the plastic tabs holding it together don't fit tight enough. Bluetooth connection is pretty solid to both Apple and Android devices.",2.0 out of 5 stars
I love the headphones in general but have found that after 30 minutes of use and they make my ears hurt. They push against my piercings into my cartilage to be quite sore. I have attempted to get replacement ear cushions in hopes of getting some a little bigger but if you change ear cushions then it voids warranty. They also do not offer replacement ear cushions from beats. So in my case they have not been worth the money I spent on them. I attempted to allow my 11 year old to use them and he states it hurts his ears also. Might be just us might be a issue for others as well. I would go with the studio headphones if you getting them over the ear.,3.0 out of 5 stars

I have had these headphones for almost 2 weeks now and I love them! They are able to connect to all of my devices via bluetooth with no issues and they hold a charge for a long time. I use them for hours on end and haven't had a problem with the battery getting low or dying on me. The sound is also great. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a bit tight on my ears and it starts to hurt after about an hours use. I ordered the gloss black which I feared may look cheap or leave fingerprint marks but it actually looks very nice in person and doesn't get dirty easily.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are awesome for working out in a crowded gym– noise cancelling enough to block out all the other machines without having to turn up my music to dangerously high volumes, big enough to signal “don’t talk to me”, and adjustable so they don’t fall off my head when I’m doing abs or something (a big problem for me, I have a tiny and weird shaped head). Plus, the matte black is very pretty (in my opinion). Plus, the automatic connection from the W1 chip to my iPhone is a MAJOR bonus over the older models; otherwise, I can’t tell much of a difference from my old Solo2s. If you don’t have an iPhone, maybe save your money and go for an older model, but if you do, then the W1 is an amazing investment. Overall, I love em!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great sound, comfortable headphones and great price! All wireless! Great color and was waiting to get these when I could afford it, but these are $110 less than I have seen elsewhere so became my birthday present to myself! Convenient with a carry case. I would have made the zipper on the carry case open wider, but that is my only complaint. Even has a carabiner to snap it on something for safe traveling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought as a gift and my husband LOVES them! He likes to listen to house music so the bass is a huge deal. He could not stop talking about how incredible they are.

The sound quality is superb though.",5.0 out of 5 stars

- Disconnecting in the middle of work online meetings and webinars
- Currently, both pairs are NOT WORKING!!!

I am utterly disappointed, upset and I would never EVER recommend this product!

"Liked them, sound was good, but they crapped out. No power. No lights. Charge was good while it lasted. Bought a new battery, but it didn’t fix them.

Super expensive for headphones that only made it 2 years. And, I really babied them. I have other Bluetooth cans and speakers (JBL’s and Mpow’s) that are much less expensive that are still working great. Surprisingly great sound on the cheaper ones also.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"So, everything came great and it was good quality. I just got a headache from wearing them because it was too tight on my head and the pressure changed in my ears.

"I'm a huge Disney nut & wanted these soooo bad but didn't want to pay $300. So when they finally went on sale during Black Friday deals, I was super excited!! At first they great & then after about an hour, they became really uncomfortable on my ears. It felt as though they were clamping my ears down to my head like a vice grip. I tried adjusting them, taking out my earrings or just moving them around in general. The only thing that helped was taking them off. I was so disappointed and had no choice but to return them. They were no good to me if I couldn't wear them for more than an hour at a time.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Two weeks without charging. Everyday use. The only down fall is the case in which the headphones come.

Worth the price for the quality and duration of battery!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I recommend these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Can’t say enough about the battery life. Bought them for my 12 year old who consistently is hooked up to wired headphones. He uses them for hours during the day and hasn’t had to charge them in 3 weeks. They still have 53% battery life left. Specifications say 70hr battery life but I really didn’t expect it. Only downfall is, the case provided with them is a soft case and not very protective so I would definitely consider spending an additional $10 on a hard case for them.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"My biggest complaint is that for an iOS device there’s no iOS App. You have to go into Widgets and add Battery in order to see the level. Another issue is it should either charge via lightning or USB c cable, not micro USB.

"The sound quality is amazing and the battery duration is very long lasting.

I loved mine while they lasted. Now only one side works when I connect it through bluetooth. The head pad that it has is going to come off really fast after you use them for a couple of months.

As people have pointed out, it's just dissapointing that you're paying a premium price and you're not quite what you expect.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for my Wife - she loved them so much I bought another pair (not pink!) for myself and I have to say that overall, when paired with iPhone, they are amazing. Extreme battery life. Fast charging and sync very nicely.

I did have to buy earphone covers to use them for running though as they have a moisture shutoff that triggers if you sweat a lot.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I travel a ton for work and rely on headphones that will reduce the white noise of the planes engines when attempting to watch movies/shows or listen to music. These headphones were great at achieving that and super great in instantly connecting with my apple products. Two stars were taken off for general build quality as the connection point for the right ear broke upon adjustment after just a few months. Would consider buying new model if build issues were resolved.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"bought for 13 year old son for his birthday. This was the best price I could find after looking around online and in local stores. I wasn't entirely sure my son would like the gold color, but he was thrilled by them and they're much more fun than the basic black. He's had them almost two months with lots of daily use. I like that they come with a case to take them along with us in the car or traveling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Beats delivers amazing quality in their solo 3 wireless headphones. Long lasting battery life and quick charges allows for tons of listening time. High quality sound and a beautiful Disney design makes these great for any music and Disney fan.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Headphones worked fine until sliding function broke. We used tape to hold it in place. Sent the product in and they refused to honor the warranty because applying tape was an ""unauthorized modification"". The tech couldn't care less and I've heard this is commonplace for Apple. They have your money...and guess what...they will gladly send you a new pair at ""market value"" which is currently $40 more than I paid for them. They broke within 2 months of ownership. Guess my son will have no headphones for his virtual school he is forced to attend. Thanks Apple for your compassion and commitment to reliability!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was very hesitant on buying Beats because normally they're heavy on the bass and muffled on the treble. Not with the Solo3. These were extremely well rounded in the Bass/ Treble. Don't get me wrong, these headphones have a lotta Bass at a high volume and the treble is adjusted acoustically to sound normal and not muffled. At a low volume, the treble jumps out at you with a crystal clear sound and the bass is adjusted to a low roar.

The weight is pretty well distributed. They sit pretty well on your head with no extreme tightness on the ears or the head. Yes, they sit on the ears instead of over the ears. I didn't realize this until I received them. I have used some like this in the past and didn't care for the feel or the sound of them. Once I tried on the Solo3, I could tell this wasn't the same story like in the past. The leather padding is great. A pillow - like feel on the ears makes these comfortable to wear for hours. Adjusting them is very easy also. Just pull , right above the headphone, up or down to fit your ear height. Also the headphones fold inward for easy storage.

Battery usage is definitely a plus on these Beats! Their claims that it last about 40 hours is right on target. The first time I used them, the battery lasted about 38 hours but after I charged them it went as long as 42 hours on a single charge so go figure. The 10 minute fast charge does last a good 3 hours so that is definitely a plus in my book.

As for looks, you can't go wrong. Typical Beats good looks, just packaged in a smaller size. I went with the flat or matte black. I don't care for the ""fingerprint"" look so I didn't go with the glossy black because reviewers say it is a fingerprint magnet.

Connection is a breeze with Bluetooth and even better if you have the iPhone 7. If you don't have the iPhone 7 or iOS 10+ then Bluetooth connectivity is as usual: turn on the Bluetooth on your device and look for Solo3. For IPhone 7 or iOS 10+ just turn on the Bluetooth and connect it once and your iPhone will remember the Solo3. Now, the next time you turn on your Beats headphones it will automatically connect to your iPhone.

The Beats Solo3 package came with its own storage bag, USB A-to-USB micro-B for charging and a male to male 3.5mm cord to use the headphones without the use of the Bluetooth.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Not sure what the previous buyers received but I just got these Solo3 headphones December 2019 and they are phenominal! I was nervous ordering them after reading the previous reviews, but I’m SO glad I ignored them in this case. The packaging is legitimate and everything that is supposed to come with them comes with them. The sound is A++ and the noise cancellation is perfect! Buy them! They are worth it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These aren’t advertised to be noise-canceling, so I’m not sure why I’m asked to rate that aspect. My only complaint is that the ear cups hurt my ears over time; I’m not sure why they’re smaller than the Beats and Beats 2 I also own. I love the sound and the wireless feature - holds a charge forever!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I use my beats every day to listen to music, podcasts, and audiobooks.

You do have to break them in though, they hurt really bad for the first few days after only an hour or two of wearing and I have a small head.

They also get stretched out and then become too loose, so I can't use them to work out or really do anything but sit or walk while wearing. I don't even trust wearing them while washing dishes because they'll slip forwards off my face.

I love my beats but I wish they were designed to fit better.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I got these things as a gift from my wife last Christmas. By June the black cover around the ear piece began to fall off. Called in and covered under warranty and replaced no problem. Fast forward 6 months doing same exact thing but warranty no longer applies after they are replaced once. Definitely won’t buy this brand ever again. Shortly after the foam wore off they completely quit working on the right side. Technically $200 for 6 months of use,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Solo3 will not disappoint! If you're looking for headphones with crippling bass these ain't it. However, the balance of sound from high, low and mid is amazing! The bass doesn't drown out the others, nor do the others cancel the bass effect. Just a well rounded pair of headphones. Love them!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I didn't read the reviews before purchasing these, but after hitting the purchase button I decided to go through some and see if there was a common issue. Well, I kept seeing that people were reporting getting fakes/refurbished products. So I became alarmed. They were same day delivery so when I got home and saw the box I was nervous I was sent fakes or refurbished headphones. Well after doing thorough research and watching several youtube videos, I discovered they were in fact real. I have had them for a week now and my only complaint is that they are a bit tight over my ears where my glasses are, but I suppose that's my bad for wearing glasses. Otherwise, they hold a charge forever, my last beats (purchased new at Best Buy) only lasted maybe 6-8 hours. These can go a few days which is nice. The sound quality is good, though they are not noise cancelling. I didn't need that since I mainly use these in my office at work, and I want to be able to hear if someone knocks at my door or walks in. Overall, pretty good!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought this for my son. Who said the sound is excellent. The ear muffs ""just"" covers the ears. but this is fine watching my son who plays D1 HS Basketball he'll take this off and leave around his neck. Because the ear muffs are small it doesn't get in the way under his chin. We tested the range some bit. No problem about 30ft. away. Sound and stream was still excellent. of course you'll always have the disance limitations set forth with Bluetooth tech specifications.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They were beautiful and great sound but hurt my ears. I ended up returning these and getting a really nice pair of off brand, over the ear headphones and they are much more comfortable than these and have just as equally good sound quality and noise cancellation. It was very disappointing these didn’t work out.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros: These headphones have great quality sound.
Cons: they smash my ears so after wearing them for any period of time my ears are sore. Overall they are not comfortable to wear. Additionally the case that they come in is ever so slightly bigger than the headphones so they have to be put in the case perfectly to fit.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are great quality headphones. I have owned a bunch of Beats headphones in the past but this is my first wireless pair. The bluetooth function works great and they can be converted to wired headphones just by plugging in the included wire. Sound clarity is amazing along with the bass. The only issue I have with these, as with all solo's, is that after having them on your head for an extended time they will hurt your ears/ make them sore. I would opt for he studios if you can.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Really happy with the product. The only downside is that they sent the wrong color ( it was supposed to be gold and they are rose gold) unfortunately I leave to see my family next week and could not return. They are a gift for a boy so it’s kind of sad. Other than that, they work great!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"For $200 I expected these to last longer than 3 weeks! Within a 3 week time span the sound went completely out in one ear and was off and on in the other ear, by week 5 there was no sound coming out of the headset at all! They were a birthday gift to my son and I have not been able to get them replaced or repaired, so I just wasted $200. I will never trust Beats ever again!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these headphones for my sons birthday last November. He loved them. Couldn’t be happier. About 2 weeks ago he started having trouble with the right headphone. Sometimes he could hear out of it and sometimes he couldn’t. It finally gave out. He was so sad and I was frustrated because the 12-month warranty is about to expire. I contacted the company I purchased it from on amazon and they were wonderful. Answered my email right away and they should be sending replacement headphones. I’m
Hoping they come before my sons birthday. He will be so excited and happy. Follow up review to follow once they send them and we receive them. :)",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I ordered these beats because I could no longer wear my airpods with my new tragus piercing. The sound quality is great and the battery seems to last a really long time. My biggest complaint is that these are super uncomfortable for my ears. they hold on tightly and it’s like my ears are sore when I take them off. If it weren’t for that, I’d give them 5 stars. The color is nice and they seem durable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love my beats. Sounds great, easy to connect to my S8 phone or iPod. Battery last long. Charges fast. I use it during my train ride to work or workouts. My only regret is getting them in silver where the earpiece is white. They get dirty and you have to be careful cleaning them without damaging it. Otherwise, it's a great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not going to delve into the subjective territory of sound quality. I will say that the sound is rich and performs better than expected (especially given Beats' history of emphasizing bass). The battery life is stellar and Bluetooth connection has been impeccable with amazing range and only rare hiccups. My one complaint is that it is a snug fit on my ears: after 1-2 hours, they actually start to hurt my ears a little.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for my son who wrestles. He rocked these before 87 individual matches to get pumped up. No complaints. No issues with sweat. Great batter life. He's completely 100% content. 3 star on noice cancelling, but they aren't advertised as such. Eveything else is great.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Just got my Beats in the mail and I am absolutely in love with them!!! Sound is awesome, feel great on, love the matte black, brand new wrapped in plastic and everything inside was wrapped nicely as well. These are not reused or fake, they are the real deal! SO happy with my purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited so long to buy the headphones. I tested them at an Apple Store and was amazed by the sound fidelity and bass. Even my wife was impressed. But I wasn’t in a good financial status, so I skipped the purchase at the time. That was last year. I heard about Amazon Prime days and decided to wait. The Solo 3 was the 1st thing that popped out when searching for electronic devices. And for $139 this time I would not let it pass away. Simply the best headphones that I have bought. And let me tell you I have bought many.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Good quality sound, looks nice, but cheap quality. However the first one I got malfunctioned with virtually no physical damage. I got a replacement. However the replacement broke a few months later again with no physical damage. I am disappointed. The headphones don't work wirelessly under 0 degrees centigrade (32 F) so if you live in an area that gets cold in the winter expect to bring the wire.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Let’s start with, I love Mickey. I definitely waited for the price to drop because (sorry, not sorry) Beats just isn’t worth it. The Mickey print is a beautiful matte. I really adore them but of course the sound quality/clarity just isn’t there.

I got these on Prime Day for a discounted price. I am not a headphone connoisseur but I was looking for something that was a little more suited for the office than my wireless in ear headphones I use at the gym. I have a loud intern that sits next to me who is the life of the office and needed something to block the noise out. It works. A little too well sometimes. I jump out of my skin at least 4 times per day when someone touches my shoulder or I see them out of the corner of my eye. Works for me.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've been a content user of corded, over-the-ear-headphones forever, always barely tolerating the cord getting hung up on my office chair several times a day... I've also been a bit of a snob about the Beats brand, shunning the brand hype and the expense. Not sure what put me over the edge, but I couldn't be happier that I made the leap/cut the cord. These headphones are fantastic. Battery life is excellent - I've had them for about 2 months and the battery still is half-charged. Great bluetooth range, superb sound. I use them daily at my desk job and at home (yard work, wood working projects, etc.). The controls on the headset are slick as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love these things because they cancel out loud, obnoxious noises (like your animals whining while you're trying to focus and study for a big test). They are also very comfortable to wear. I've had on-ear headphones in the past that were so tight they gave me a headache. I could wear these all day studying if I needed to!",5.0 out of 5 stars
I was surprised by the solo 3s good sounding. Use them as workout headphones. Not worth 300 but got them on sale and they are good sounding plenty of volume not to bass heavy but got good sound and bass to them. And still using them to work out with no problems. Of course they always go back into the case.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent fit powerful sound I actually gave these to my daughter she wanted some wireless headphones for when she works out at the gym these have met her expectations and more they are very comfortable she said I have tried them on and they are very comfortable with that and the sound is great if you’re looking for the beat sound with the wireless capability then I would recommend these,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I really like these headphones overall, the sound quality is good and they're decently noise-isolating. HOWEVER, I've had them only for about a year, and the battery life and their condition has declined significantly. While previously I only had to charge them once a month (with use for HOURS daily) now they barely last a few days. In addition, one of the side hinges is broken, and that side of the headphones doesn't stay collapsed, and will kind of swing out at random. In general, I like these, but please be warned that they probably won't last much more than a year and a half with normal use. Personally, I think they're far too expensive to have declined this quickly.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these in November of 2018. It’s June of 2020 and they are already broken. One ear isn’t working at all and the other if I press on it it will work otherwise it goes in and out and sounds like static. For the price, they should last a lot longer than what they did. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these head phones precisely for the noise cancellation feature. My spouse has to have the volume so high while watching tv I was in Hope's of being able to cancel out the sound and listen to another device while being able to say in same room as the tv. Did not cancel noise.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Wanted to buy the Wifey a BOSE noise cancelling headphone instead, but she wanted these. Regret not doing it, but I’m a die hard BOSE fan. These are a nice set of headphones though. They produce great sound, not noise cancelling so if your looking for total submersion into the music, get some Noise cancelling headphones. All in all she’s happy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Five months and one side of the headphones goes out. The product started malfunctioning yesterday. Now, whenever I try to connect to a device wirelessly, one side is cut out. Not to mention the constant audio break up. The cord also stopped working after a month. Very disappointing. What a waste of $230!",1.0 out of 5 stars
I wear these headphones everyday to the gym and have been wearing them for a long time now. the sound quality is still amazing. the battery lasts extremely long and it charges very quick when low. one of the earphone covers just started to come undone but with the amount I have been wearing and sweating in them they still work amazing.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I absolutely love these headphones for my workouts. I previously had ear plugs and they were constantly coming out of my ear whenever I sweat so I would have to frequently stop my workouts to put back and readjust them in my ear which got super annoying when i'm trying to concentrate on burning some fat. I've been using these for about a week now and they are really great, i can focus on my workouts and the sound quality is totally bomb. i won't go into all the specs and technical mumbo jumbo cuz i don't know them, but if you're looking for something that stays put and has good sound quality and long battery life you can't go wrong with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I live in NYC, where the temperature at the the winter could be very low. For a couple of days temperature dropped down under 32 deegres Fahrenheit and I have difficulties to use my headphones outside my apartment. After 5 minutes outside, headphones switching off by themself. I can not turn them back on until, I am back to a warmer place for at least 5-10 minutes. I sent a message to Beats by Dre tech support, and I received an answer saying the optimum temperature for using this headphones is above 32 deegres Fahrenheit. So it means that I not gonna be able to use this product through the winter. On my opinion Beats shoul inform customers that they could expect difficulties using this equipment in the cold environment.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I have tried a few different head phones but wanted blue tooth and smaller ear cup size so it didn't look weird while I listed at work. For the price I really dont notice a great sound difference from something like my BOHM headphones at a third of the price. I have glasses and these things kill my ear as they are so tight with no way to loosen them. I would have expect more out of something so pricey.,3.0 out of 5 stars
They were working well the first 2 weeks and then everything went down hill. The sound would start failing in the right ear until it was completely gone and I could only hear from one ear. Then it wouldn’t connect to the Bluetooth on my phone. And after a while I had to call amazon for help on what to do because I had it for a little over a month.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Best wireless headphones hands-down! These are the easiest plug and play headphones ever. Right out of the box, they come with easy to start instructions, how to use the buttons and connect blue tooth. I was up and running in less than 2 minutes. They also fold really well into a case that is included. I'm really happy with the sounds, and they are very much noise-cancelling in my opinion even though I'm not sure it's advertised to be. Very comfortable, long battery life and well worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They look great. If looks are your thing, grab these. If you don’t really care about looks and sound quality is your thing then you can definitely find something better for this price. That’s the biggest issue with Beats.. Price. But even then, the sound isn’t bad, just not good enough for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Poorly made headphones. While the sound quality and noise cancelation are great, within six months of use the padding cover started coming off. For the amount of money spent on these, that shouldn’t have been an issue. I had knockoffs that lasted years.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First problem may not be 100% Beat's fault, however, they are an Apple product. They don't play nice with Bluetooth. Failure and intermittent connection, dropped connection, both on Apple computers. Maybe not Beat's fault, but they are useless for the intended purpose if unable to establish a reliable Bluetooth connection.
Second problem, they are uncomfortably tight on the ears.
Third, the on/off switch offers no tactile functionality. The headphones must be removed and looked at in order to power on (or off).
The sound quality and noise cancelling are fine, but so is every other brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"They worked amazing for the first couple months and then I had trouble with Bluetooth connection, the aux cord thing it comes with had a short in it so it sounds static-y with it in PLUS to top it off the right side stopped working on the headphones.

HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Love Beats overall, have used the wired ones for a few years. And now have the wireless. I highly recommend. These are perfect for people with smaller features.

Read the instructions to figure out the headset controls like volume.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Fantastic headphones that quickly became a staple in my workout routine. I enjoy the moderate noise cancellation they provide. It’s not perfect, but I never needed it to be. It blocks just enough noise to allow for a nap on a plane or to focus on your workout in the gym. I really love these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I love the Beats brand. They never fail when it comes to great sound. The quality of these headphones are great. They are very durable. The color is my favorite so that is great too. The battery lasts forever. I usually use these while i'm working out and doing chores around my house and I may have to charge them twice a month. This is my second pair of beats and they are only getting better.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my second set of Beats, the first Blue tooth. These are super comfortable, and easy to install on both my iPhone and iPad. However, since I live in colder climate, if the temps are in the upper to mid 30s, the headphones only last 15 mins at the most. Even if I wear a hoodie, they don't last much longer. This happens when the battery is fully charged, so there must be a shutoff when the headphones hit a certain temp. The battery doesn't drain, it just turns off. I would not buy these again.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I connect them via Bluetooth as I have on very flight and the right earphone has no sound. I spend every minute u til takeoff trying to google remedies and disconnect/reconnect and reset. I didn’t get them wet, used the case religiously. If I had known they wouldn’t last 13 months I would not have spent that much. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was super excited to get these headphones. After about 20 minutes of wearing them, i took them off and my ears were throbbing! They are very painful to wear. I can't get past the pain so I'll be returning these, which is unfortunate because the sound is amazing and they fit me way better then the Bose soundlink headphones.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Stylish and sound great, but stopped working properly after less than a year. One of the ears goes in and out depending on your head position. A wire is probably a little loose on the inside. As pricey as these are I'd expect them to be more durable after being stored in the case and only being used lightly for a year.

Luckily they still had 6 days left on their one year warranty and Apple repaired them for free.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"My daughter absolutely loves her new Beats, she hasn’t heard a thing anyone has said to her since Christmas morning.
All kidding aside the headphones themselves are very nice. They have amazing sound quality, and they look and feel great. It took my daughter all of 3min to connect to her phone, set them up, and start listening to music.
Will buy another pair for myself, so that I can pretend not to hear my wife.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my first over the ear headphones. They pair easily with my iPhone and my Microsoft Surface Laptop for calls and music on both devices. The sound quality is good and people say they hear me clearly. I haven’t tried outdoor calls yet where it may pick up other environmental sounds.

The only negative is they get a bit uncomfortable on my ears when I wear them for longer periods. I think the ear cushions could be softer.

Next time I’ll consider spending more for more comfortable headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Great sound and are compact so they are able to fit into smaller bags when they are folded. The battery lasts pretty long, I was quite surprised. I hardly ever have to charge them and I use them almost daily for the gym. The only complaint I have is they're not comfortable when wearing with glasses. They're a big snug on the ear so they do start to hurt a little when wearing your glasses.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Your used headphones purchased at full price may come with cat fur, earwax and dandruff like mine. That’s nasty.

I got the glossy black. Love this product. It's legit. Battery lasts a long time. Glossy black does not scratch easily. I even hit it HARD against a piece of equipment at the gym and the dent is still so tiny and not noticeable - so it is DURABLE.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"My husband loved these. They were great with his low hearing. However, they do not stand up to use while working. They have never been wet, always kept in the case. And just after the end of warranty they quit working. We think it’s because they couldn’t stand up to use while sweating. Can’t come up with any other reason for them to just quit like that after being so well taken care of. It was almost like they shorted. He was wearing them and everything was fine mowing then lawn and the boom, they were dead.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a gift. When I opened them, I was disappointed to see that the black material did not completely cover the ear phones on either side. The beige foam sticks out all around the ear phones on both sides. When I try to stretch the black material across the earphone to cover the foam—it won’t go--it’s WAY too small and will not stay in place.
If they don’t bother to refurbish them enough to make them look good on the outside, it’s doubtful that quality work was done inside. NO ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

"Best bluetooth headphone. Period. Quality is good but most important is you dont need to pair unpair anymore in order to connect to your phone, mac, ipad, watch. It connects to all at once and while listening music from mac if you get a call on iphone then you can just switch to iphone and vice versa. This is a great feature. When I go for jog then I just connect to my watch without unpairing. I have two and my daughter loves it as she can use between her laptop, phone and ipad.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The best headphones out there. Got them for my wife for Christmas and she loves them. Great deal and great quality of item. Cant beat prime with 2 day shipping. These were out of stock everywhere.

"Just got these babies today! So excited! Came in about 4 bus days. Original packaging, looks amazing. Sound quality is amazing. Was 92% charged when I put charger on and charged for about 10 min and they were ready to go. I’m very satisfied! I got the matte black, looks classy. These are a plus for me since those dang iphone buds don’t fit in my ear. Love, love, love!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love color and they where awesome to 4 times I got to use them. Bought these a year ago in January
I have taken very good care of them . I charged them last night so I could use them today and they would not pair. the pair light wont even come on. so I plugged them in to use and sound only comes out on the right and nothing on the right ! In my opinion . 300.00 is way to much to spend on something you only got to use 4 times. Ive had cheap ear phones that last way longer and when they bite the dust you can afford to replace them . Very Disappointed in this purchase",2.0 out of 5 stars

Material around the are ear headphones are separated after reading many reviews there seems to be ongoing problem I called Apple but they want to hold a credit card on file and have them mailed in.

"I had bought 1 powerbeats and it quit on me after a firmware update, got it replaced with another one and it quit for no reason, all this within 1 1/2 years. Bought a solo 3 just a couple of months ago and now it will not stay connected via BT. Called support and walked me thru the reset steps, which i had already done, now they say send it in. i'M SICK OF PAYING BIG BUCKS (224.00) NOT HAVING IT FOR MORE THAN 2 YEARS AND HAVE TO GET IT REPLACED.

"Great headphones for all purposes unless you plan on wearing them when the temperature drops near 32°F or below. These headphones have a wonderfully long battery life, effortless connections to I-devices, good sound and great usability. My problem, and it’s a big one, is that is impossible to use these headphones as a wireless device when the temperature drops close to or below freezing. At that point, the headphones turn off automatically anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes later depending on how cold it is. Sometimes, when the temperatures only at 32°, I can get up to 20 to 25 minutes before they turn off. I have called Apple and I have been told that this is typical for battery powered wireless headphones. I have not substantiated this statement with other brands.",3.0 out of 5 stars
For the price doesnt sound that good its just ok it lacks mid its mostly bass its not worth $199 or $129 on sale .jbl live 400 sounds better for $ 69 ..but quality its really good.im not sure im keeping it ill try for a week will see,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Super great headphones ever have. Was having a wired Philips and a SONY headphone, but always felt painful on both ears because wrapping too tightly to ears. This Beats Solo3 doesn't make such problem to me.

In terms of BT/wireless, it works wonderfully as I have many apple products and the Solo3 connects to all of them with easy set up and very good music quality. The long durability of battery juice and long distance of reception make me thumbs up!! I work in a lab often leave my phone on desk and walk around benches and even cross the hall way to another room. I never get problem to receive BT signals from my iphone7. It's also easy to check battery status using iphone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I had another pair of these that I ordered from Apple that were stolen and I was devastated because I love them so much that I ordered another pair. They are sound cancelling and comfortable sitting over the ear. I was never into bulky headphones like this before but after owning these I probably won't get anything else. I even use them when I shoot my gun because the noise cancelling is that good. I recommend them if you are considering buying them!,5.0 out of 5 stars
Great headset. Flawless pairing with all your apple devices. Legitimate 40 hours battery life and the range across our 3 level home no drops at all. The fatal flaw is i like to walk the dog in winter; if its cold; the unit shuts off purposely at around 32 degrees and no more music for the rest of the walk; i had 2 when i realized this i returned 1. They get more comfortable with continued use; not as comfy as the bose on ear bluetooth. Overall good purchase.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Wow. If you are a bass lover and primarily listen to rap or R&B, you are certainly in for a treat. These look great and although the clarity is not quite as good as other brands such as Bose or Sennheiser, they excel in the bass department. They are sleek and beautiful making these the best looking headphones money can buy and won’t stick out if you so chose to wear them with your favorite outfit. Overall, I strongly recommend these to just about anybody looking for a great overall headphone with great sound quality, bass, battery, aesthetics, and style all in one.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"these are awful . at first I was really happy to get them and they looked really authentic and sounded great ! I’ve had them for almost a year now and as I was dancing and listening to my music, the right speaker stopped working . not to mention the circle part that allows you to change the volume randomly fell off on its own while I was listening to music maybe 6 months back . for 6 months I have been having it taped to my headphones just for them to end up trash all together . just save the money because these ain’t it .",1.0 out of 5 stars
If you like loud music beware. The wireless on these does not allow for loud music. I tested my regular Beats Solo with the same music and phone and the wireless just wont get as loud. I sent them back. Would rather deal with wires instead of not being able to enjoy loud music.,2.0 out of 5 stars
What more can be said. The main thing you probably want to know is it new and does it look as advertised. Answer is yes to both. I just bought a second set for my son for him to use at the gym. He loves them.,5.0 out of 5 stars

I bought these for my 9 year old for his birthday and we both love them. (I use them at the gym occasionally and have even run in them). The battery lasts forever and they look sharp but not too bulky. They are comfortable and the sound is very good. I like that they fold up nicely to fit in a small case that is easy to toss into a backpack or purse. I have been very happy with this purchase and I love the gold color. Not too flashy but still cool looking.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have had these for about a year and a half and the left earphone stopped working. If you do research, this is a VERY VERY common problem and it is not an easy fix or you'll have to send it in for repair which costs a significant amount of money. Extremely disappointed that I paid this much for head phones that barely last - and mine are in pristine condition physically. I gave Beats a chance after ignoring all the 'haters' online, and now I wish I would have listened. NEVER AGAIN.

"Mine are real Beats headphones, so I don't know what the other people are talking about. Great quality sound!

Absolutely best sound I’ve heard from headphones ever! You can’t get any better quality then what I got from Beats. My only issue is that I have large ears so I’m exchanging this pair for a different color for my daughter and I’m getting the larger size.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"No active noise cancellation, the ear cups blocks some sound. I like the 40 hours play on single charge but ears get way too hot and sweaty! Little too tight for long uses, hopefully it will stretch out in time. Used it with the headphone jack and Bluetooth, the Bluetooth never dropped off. Let’s see if the sound quality gets better with use.",3.0 out of 5 stars
I actually like these and I am the furthest thing in the world from a Beats guy. The sound is fun they actually feel good on my head. Are the worth the $300 list price? Probably not but I got mine for $200 and you could probably do better than that. I just hope they hold up. Recommended.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"they fit a little tight on my head which makes it uncomfortable, but otherwise they are great. they charge so fast which is great! when you don’t have the headphones on you can hear what they are playing i would say pretty loudly, but i knew they were supposed to do that but people can easily hear what your listening to even if the it is at a very low volume.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Product has excellent sound quality and quick charging. The audio cord was broken when I received it. Thought no big deal since it was brand new and still under warranty. I was totally mistaken. When I called Apple to get a new cord, I was told that it was already out of warranty by two years. What??? The warranty started when the product was purchased two years ago by the seller (AMAZON) from Apple. Now that I know this, I will be very careful about what I purchase from Amazon. I ended up paying for a new audio cord.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these headphones for my son who is autistic and hopes that it would help cancel out some of the noise around us while he was watching videos or listening to music.

I love them they are great. They have a great sound quality and are very comfortable. I was using them in a restaurant and I couldn't hear the music playing in the background. Even though they don't have electric noise canceling any background noise is hard to hear. I like how they came with a cord to use when the headphone dies. Great quality.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I was happy with the headphones, but after 6 months the right side stopped working when being used in bluetooth mode. It works completely fine if using the cable. I did some research online and apparently others have experienced a similar situation.

For the price of this product i expected better quality that would last.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"This are my new favorite headphones. I have absolutely no complaints. The fact that they come with a detachable cord in case you forget to charge them is very nice (even if most phones can't use the cord anymore).

Also, if you have any kind of problem with them, you get access to Apple's world class customer support. Just to be clear, there was no sarcasm in that last statement, they go above and beyond. I only wish I had purchased an iPhone...",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have had many problems with the pair of beats I ordered. First of all, the hinges started making some weird noise after moderate use of 2 weeks.

Overrated in my opinion. I've owned these for a 1 year and 3 months and they are now dead. I used these 3 times a week at the gym. For $300.00 I feel like headphones should last a couple years. The once a month charging was nice but I will not be buying any more Beats.,1.0 out of 5 stars
AWESOME! If you’re on the fence about buying these then JUST DO IT! It’s crazy how well they cancel out background noise. Me and my kids “experimented” with it when they first arrived. Unbelievable!

Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves them. They must work really well because she never hears me or my wife calling her when she has them on lol.

"The beats came in what appeared to be good condition, but they do not work to talk on the phone. I don’t know if it’s an issue with the beats themselves, or the actual wire that came with the beats to use for phone calls, but when I plug the cord in, the audio only comes out of one ear and it’s bad quality.

"Great headphones for the price!! I would definitely recommend for anyone that wants good quality Bluetooth headset for a minimal price, but two caveats, one if they are one your ears for too long, they can feel uncomfortable for a minute or so when you take them off, also the volume control on the headset is great but messes up at times making me accidentally pause or skip songs entirely. However, it is overall great and worth the money if you have it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound is not audiophile quality, heavy on bass, and overall good sound quality. But what really makes them great is the technology - the W1 chip, in combination with the iPhone 7 is a great combination. Battery life is insane (in the almost 2 months I have them, I have charged them only twice. Range is also insane while connectivity is a breeze. This is the perfect wireless combination for iPhone 7, hands down.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Not worth the price, sound is not of quality with other headphones of similar pricing, Bluetooth connectivity is spotty in a multiresidential environment and made with cheap materials. Mine broke at the plastic fold mechanism, leather always pulling apart from earpiece and I babied this headset. Band is really tight, ears hurt after less than an hour of use. This came with holographic security, so assume they're real. They are just not worth the price, turns me off to any of their other products, present or future.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"My daughter got these Beats for Christmas 2017, in June 2018 one side of the headphones quit working! Apparently that is common. Apple replaced them free of charge and all was good. Then in January 2019 one side of the extension area broke. Once again I contacted Apple support, however this time instead of a 1 year warranty, the replacements only had a 90 day warranty! So I could pay $129 plus S/H to get them repaired or I could spend another $200 and just buy new ones! Neither option appealed to me!!! VERY FRUSTRATED!!!!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars

"After several weeks of researching, comparing and reading reviews, we bought the Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones. I originally wanted the Bose QuietComfort 35’s or the Beats Studios. I tried them on, tested them out in-store and was having a hard time deciding. I saw a pair of th Solo3’s and tried them on, (not sure how I’d feel about the on-ear versus the over-the-eat style.) I was amazed that the Solo3 sounded just as great as the Bose (in my opinion). While not offering noise canceling, I could still hear most things around me with the Bose and Beats Studios. I felt the sound quality was just as good and I could hear just as much noise with the Solo3’s as the other two with noise-canceling. So we bought two, had them for 2 weeks now and traveled with them... we are extremely happy with them and would buy them again!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"The BEST headphones I have ever owned. Im a bit of a sucker for looks and brand which people criticize a lot of Beats users for but I say screw those people because you can have both looks AND quality with Beats. I had the beats solo 2 wireless and I cant begin to tell you what a step up the Solo 3's are. The battery life is seriously unbelievable. I use them ranging from 3-4 hours a day and sometimes up to 6 hours (I use them for work) and the battery lasts WEEKS its seriously incredible. When the battery gets low ill charge for 5 minutes and it's back up to 3 dots. It's INCREDIBLE, I dont even think my old Nokia's battery lasted this long! The finish of these headphones is about the same as the Solo 2's except for the gorgeous shiny rose gold accents as opposed to the fully matte finish of the Solo 2's. These headphones look amazing, sound even better, and the battery lasts a ridiculously long time. The price tag is hefty but as someone who uses these every day for work they were worth every penny.

I've noticed some people complaining about the same issue the Solo 2's had. It's uncomfortable to use them for an extended period of time because they are tight. Yes, at first they ARE pretty tight on your skull and are unbearable for over 2 hours. However, over time they DO stretch out and guys this happens to most On-Ear headphones. If you have very large ears I would recommend getting the Studios since they are OVER ear. If you want to speed out the stretch out process just stretch them out over something about the same size as your head and leave them overnight. Repeat this until they are comfy although dont stretch them too much or they will fall easily. I use these now for up to 6 hours at a time and they are very comfy. If you have earrings you might want to take them off before prolonged use, the back of the earrings will be poking into your skull.

Overall these headphones impressed me and this is coming from someone who already owned the great Solo 2's. You will not regret getting these.

"The sound quality was very good, but the headphones leak a lot of sound so if you're listening in a quiet place, everyone can hear your music.

Again though, if you plan on doing anything active, these are not the right ones. Update, the rubber cushion on the head strap came off of the headphones",5.0 out of 5 stars

"First I was spectical that these were even on sale because we all know Beats are overpriced for what you get. Thank being said, since these are discounted they are definitely a great buy. I wouldn't spend $300 on these but I will $220. These are real and they came in the original packaging.

Now for the review. As others have noticed that Beats are very bass heavy, I like this even though I listen to a lot of metal but to some they don't like it. The sound populated is excellent. There aren't any cracks or interruptions at all. These are a very high quality SOUND headphone. My issue isn't with the sound or the Bluetooth connectivity.

These headphones, as other solos are, are built cheap. The sound coming out is great but the design is made out of plastic and i wouldn't recommend anyone going to the gym with these. Get the power beats if you're going to the gym. These feel like they will break and I have a feeling they will If I drop them hard enough. The ear cups re great leather quality and feel comfortable. I wish they went away with the plastic and made all the models like the beats pro were. The material in the design definitely needs work.

The Bluetooth connectivity is marvelous with this W1 chip. The range is insane. I went outside my house and down the street and was still connected without interuption. i don't understand everyone saying connecting is any different. Yes there's a pop up that says connect but all my other bluetooth headphones automatically connect after the initial set up anyway so I don't get this ""amaazing set up"" everyone is talking about.

One more thing I would like to point out are phone calls. The phone calls are so crystal clear. No one can tell I'm using headphones which is hard with Bluetooth nowadays. All around these are a great buy and I would buy them again (not for $300 of course). Sound quality is great, cal quality is great, if you can get over the plastic buy these!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"These are great over the ear headphones. I didn't want to jump on the iPod craze as I was afraid I would misplace them, but also do not like the ""in ear"" feel. These are comfortable and they fold so that they are easy to store and transport when not in use.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Ouch! Maybe just me, and maybe I have a large head, but these things were very painful after wearing for only 15 minutes. Thankfully, I was able to return them without a hassle. Otherwise, the sound quality was excellent.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Had them a few weeks now. Could not be happier. I was apprehensive about buying them as I’ve never had really nice headphones before but they’re a fantastic product. Easy pairing. Great sound quality. Not noice cancelling but very good sound quality & overeat gives all I need in this department. Super long battery life. Comfortable. The case is sleek & provides good protection.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Definitely the best investment in headphones I have ever made. The quality in sound is absolutely amazing. They are also very comfortable and just nice to look at. The carrying case is great to have when traveling and also keeps them from getting dusty when you’re not using them. Overall if you want great quality sound and performance, you will want these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I typically wouldn't ever spend more than $40 on a pair of headphones but I LOVE my breasts so much. I just them for the gym and not only is the quality amazing but the fit is great as well.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"After 1 month of having my first pair, the battery stopped charging. When I tried to charge them, no light would light up and when trying to turn them on a red light would blink. Since they were still under warranty I returned them and they gave me new pair. About 13 months later (right when the warranty expired), the battery stopped charging again. When I went to Apple to get them fixed they were going to charge me $126!!! Save yourself from some trouble and just buy another brand.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Fun set of headphones. Great sound quality.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound is amazing and they're so comfortable! I think these are the best headphones I've ever had.

IMPORTANT NOTE: You should get a hard case to store them.

Some months after the purchase, the left headphone just stopped working when connected to bluetooth, but it worked perfectly fine when I used the 3,5mm jack. Luckily, I managed to get some new ones from Apple.

My guess is that storing them in the provided fabric bag harmed somehow the wiring, since the headphones barely fit in it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Much cheaper units out there but bought these for the 40h battery life for 2 kids in cars/planes. So far ok. If you don’t care if you have to charge after every 10h of use I’d definitely buy cheaper/better quality made then this.,4.0 out of 5 stars

"What is better than Mickey Mouse?? Nothing! I was sold on these as soon as I found them. The price of the Mickey edition was just icing on the cake. I am very happy with these and I get a ton of compliments on this edition of my Beats. They did not come with a charger or the cord pictured, which wasn't a deal breaker for me once I got them but it could be for someone else. I would definitely recommend these.",4.0 out of 5 stars

I returned them. I thought they would be noise cancelling (especially for the price). They are not. They were uncomfortable and sound quality was sub-par. I suggest the Cowin headphones instead.,3.0 out of 5 stars
love the headphones bought them for all my long summer flights on the planes....but the cord to plug into the TV on the plane stopped working after one use. Contacted Apple and they replaced but only had sound in one ear all the way home on a 5 hour flight. Hope the next time I use them I don't have this issue again!!,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Don't buy these. These are the second pair I've gotten and they both stopped working in the same way. The first pair worked for about 2 weeks then it started having issue with charging and connecting wirelessly. Amazon replaced them and after a few more weeks, the same issue has come up. Now the 2nd pair doesn't charge properly or connect wirelessly. Too much money to spend on headphones that malfunction so easily.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"These headphones are super cute, and work well. If you're planning on using these to workout you should be aware of the pros and cons.
Pros: You can put your phone down and not have to worry about dropping it.
Cons: When you sweat, they slip off your head and the pads get squishy.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"So comfortable to wear because they don't slip around on my head. The only thing that I don't like is how hot my ears get while I'm wearing them. But, I thought that might happen with the full ear coverage. It is worth it to have such great sound while I'm walking, out doing yard work, or working. On top of all that, I love the color.

"Great that I received someone else's used beats... I was a little skeptical when the box was not even wrapped. When I opened it, the headphones were scratched up and the cups had earwax in them. Absolutely unlike Amazon to send used beats when they are marked as new. When I paired to the device, it already pops up as Christian's beats solo 3. So Christian, absolutely brilliant but you need to clean your ears. As if that wasn't enough, the left ear just did not work at all. Very disappointed. Save yourself the trouble, buy these at best buy for the same price.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Received these today and they are difinently not beats. They are the cheapest knock off I can imagine. No power button, no volume buttons, no charging port and no markings of beats at all.

The sound was great and all but the headphones just felt a little used. Shipping was fast though but I'm going to have to ask for a refund. I bought these for my girlfriend and my sister has the same ones; these didn't very much look the ones my sister got from best buy.,3.0 out of 5 stars
I have been using these headphones at the gym every day for a couple months now and the headphones have gotten loose to the point that I have to hold them in place if I am doing anything like looking down... a bit disappointed as I have taken extremely careful care of them and always put them back in case when not in use.,3.0 out of 5 stars

"These are the second pair of beats I have purchased, and they are great. I know they get a lot of complaints by music professionals as not being ""the"" top quality music output. However, to my amateur ears, I think that they are perfectly fine. The battery lasts forever....I usually have to charge them only every 2-3 weeks, and use them almost every day. Compared to pretty much any other rechargeable product, their battery life is amazing. I don't know how many long haul flights I have planned, and the morning of realized that I had forgotten to charge my ipad/computer...etc. These headphones are great, since they last so long. The music quality is more than sufficient for me, and the fact that they fold up means I can throw them in my purse pretty easily. I use them on my commute, for travel, and when I work out! Great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Item worked for a few months. Now they will not ppwer on and stay on. Upon trying to regoster for support unable to do so. I do not see help offered from Amazon site for assistance.

And I'm not talking about arctic temps, I'm merely outside in mid-20's degrees, and the battery shuts down. I looked at the beats website and other sites, and this is a well-known design flaw.

I love them. Easy to pair with my car and Android phone. Beautiful. Expensively made.

Gorgeous headphones but they hurt when I'm wearing them because they press against my ears. Gives me a headache. I don't recommend. The bigger ones are way more comfortable.,3.0 out of 5 stars

"My daughter loves these! She has had other headphones previously however, nothing compares to the wireless Beats in terms of quality and comfort. The sound quality is great and the feel on your ears is very comfortable. Purchasing a hard carrying case is a must to ensure these are kept protected at all times.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Earpiece is a little tight...and I have pretty small ears, but the noise reduction is good. Just can’t wear them for more than an hour which can be a little tough if watching a movie.
Beautiful color!",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones work really well and have great sound. The rose gold is a great color.,5.0 out of 5 stars
I love these headphones. My husband can be watching tv or playing his guitar and I don’t hear it. On an airplane the engine is barely audible. The battery life is amazing and having Mickey on them is just a plus! I can use my iPhone or iPod with them as it comes with a wire! I like the fact that old music or new the sound and volume level is the same!,5.0 out of 5 stars

"They were my Mother’s Day gift.
I loved them.
3 months later I was using them one day and I tried turning them off.
They never turned off till they ran out of battery

I’ve tried resetting them and everything apple tells me to do so far nothing’s worked:(",2.0 out of 5 stars

"I have had beats since the first Solo On-Ear Headphones came out. Since then, they have much improved on overall quality and comfort. So far my favorite is the Beats Solo3, though price-wise the original Solo cannot be beat. (the Solo2 was a disaster)",5.0 out of 5 stars
This headphones 🎧 rock. Deep bass. Clear treble. The best sounding headphones I have ever used. They are comfortable for extended wear. They have a 40 hour battery. I can’t say enough. Worth every penny.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"We've loved these headphones, but the bluetooth stopped working on one side after 4 months of use. We've taken very good care of them, and they are great headphones, but for the price I planned on them lasting a lot longer than 4 months. The headphones still work with the cord ... but that kind of defeats the purpose of getting wireless headphones.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"Quality of sound is amazing. This is the second pair I’ve owned (first pair was stolen out of car). I was determined to replace them. Finally did and frankly a little disappointed in the actual hardware. It’s been a month, haven’t a used them too much, I usually need the smallest size setting but this pair is slightly defective, the left side doesn’t stay “closed” even when being worn. Aside from defect disappointment of this pair, highly recommend the brand.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"While the sound quality is pretty good, the craftsmanship is absolute garbage. Within two months of owning mine, the leather on the ears was falling off and the carrying case has a wonky zipper. I do like them, but you can get much higher quality headphones for a similar price.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are so awesome. I really wanted wireless headphones that would stay put while I was working out, and these do a beautiful job with that. So, I can work out, listen to amazing quality sound, and never re-adjust. I could get all technical and specific but I think that says it all!! They're pricey but so worth it! Added bonus, they look pretty too <3",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I seriously wanted to love these.
Even using different EQ settings it just didn't have the quality of sound I've found from less expensive Bluetooth headphones. They have great battery life and range, but if you like to hear bass like, like a bass chello. Forget it. Even in deep bass EQ. it's a no go.
Just very unimpressed. Not at all what I expected or hoped for. Returning these.",2.0 out of 5 stars
Its an amazing headphone but the ear piece was to small for me and kept hurting my ears so exchanged it for a different beats,3.0 out of 5 stars
"Apple has a problem with the batteries in their headphones. I've bought 4 pairs of them either for myself or as gifts and 2 of them have had the same battery failure issue. Eventually they just stop charging. Then you have to drive into the Apple store, wait in line, have them send them out, and drive back. Fortunately they often get stolen before they fail. That's about the best feature. The sound is good when they work. Would never buy another pair.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I'm loving these wireless headphones! Audiophiles complain about the sound quality but it sounds good to me and I listen to classical (think booming Wagner) to rock. The only drawbacks are the price tag and the less than intuitive controls. It comes w a storage bag which is nice for travel.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Update after a year of light use:. It's literally falling to pieces. Horrible build quality. Audio quality was great while it lasted. Expected a lot more durability at this price point.,2.0 out of 5 stars

"Sound was ok. (not great. The minimum you would expect of 2019). Unfortunately, When you try to watch a video (posted 7-23-19), everything lags. YouTube, Netflix, etc. Perhaps I received a defect in product, but if not do not buy this. You can find a much better deal arround 20-30$. Also, the beats 2 were better.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Great price with Amazon prime day!!!!!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"huge bass enhancement ( you can definitely tell from side-by-side comparison with Beyerdynamic T51i ), quite a lot clamping force. can't wear it for longer than 1 hour .
sound quality is decent, it's not bad imo, small sound stage due to the on-ear fact, human vocal is mushy and not as clear as other headphones within this price range. it's a fun headphone and like it so far.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Ignore all the haters, these headphones sound incredible. The battery life on these things blow my mind. It seems like 20+ hours of battery life and they recharge very quickly. Connectivity is a breeze with any Apple product and I would imagine the same can be said for Android products as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Bought these September 2019 after owning previous beats headphones for 4+ years. Within a couple months I noticed connectivity issues; it would randomly disconnect from my phone mid convo. Most recently, (four days ago) there's been no sound coming from the right side and as of tonight it won't connect via Bluetooth to my phone/ laptop.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"It took about five months for me to decide to finally get them, and one I did my mind became blown! They are worth the purchase if you have been thinking about buying them. Perfect for the gym and easy to keep clean if you care for them. I recommend buying some covers for the ears just to make a little more comfortable but honestly you don’t have to.

"Right speaker went out within 2 months after normal wear - no active wear (running, working out, etc.) They were fantastic - great sound - better than last edition, though did become uncomfortable after extended use. Still bass heavy but sound was much improved.

I, of course, did not get the 4-year protection plan. Have been burnt on beats buds, but figured wireless wouldn't experience the same shortage issue.",3.0 out of 5 stars

Sound qaulity is very good and has a nice balance. The battery life is excellent and charges for the length advertised. The material qaulity is pretty good but not perfect.

(I was sponsored by a company to buy these headphones) I bought them for 12$ for a month (Tax). The headphones are really great sounding which is always expected by beats. Although the sound quality is great the Plastic that they are made of is poor. The headphones fall off your head easily so playing sports with these headphones are really not recommended.

These headphones worked fine yesterday and most of today. Then suddenly the sound is super muffled and I have no idea why. Not sure if I got a defective pair or if these are knockoffs.

The on the ear design isn’t comfortable and I can’t tell if that is just because they are on my ears instead of over them as my bose are or if the band is just too small for my head and is squeezing the ear pieces to my ears instead applying a little pressure to keep them in place,2.0 out of 5 stars

"Wanted a decent pair of wireless headphones after always catching a cord at work and breaking other pairs. I looked at a few pairs, these, some Bose headphones and some V-Moda. Honestly these probably had the lowest reviews of the 3. Not bad reviews, but lower than the other two in general so I was hesitant. I also had never read great things about older Beats, but they came down in price some to about 70 less than the other two so I decided to give it a shot.

I am pleasantly surprised. I am by no means an audiophile so that may help, but I think they sound very good. Pretty full sound, I don't think it's the best by any means, but it's a good sound and enjoyable to listen to. Range also seems really good on the bluetooth.

As far as comfort. They definitely could be tight to some. They kind of clamp down on the ears. I don't find this bad, but it's definitely something to consider in a purchase. I think overall they are very comfortable so far. A little hot under the ears after a bit maybe, but not bad.

I would recommend them if you want a decent pair of wireless headphones. Good sound, easy to pair, comfortable. Oh, and it also came with 30 bucks on the itunes store or 3 months of apple music. Since I will use that it's like I saved another 30 bucks on them which really makes them a great deal.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I am extremely pleased with this purchase. First of all, it arrived on time and in great condition. I was a bit skeptical about purchasing due to some of the comments that I read, however, I decided to bite the bullet and make the purchase. There were concerns if the headphones were genuine (as in, true Beats)- yes, they are. These Beats by Dre wireless headphones are the best, I do not know why I waited so long to make the purchase! The sound is crisp and clear and my music sounds like it is live.

Setup was not difficult and I like that it automatically pairs with my phone so I can listen to my music. I have a Samsung S7 and it works perfectly- no problems at all.

I purchased these headphones for the gym. I lift weights, spin, and run in them. I have not experienced the issue some people complain about regarding sweating (and I tend to sweat when I am running). My headphones still stay on my head. For those that have that issue, I would recommend tying a scarf on your head. It will help hold the headphones in place.

Overall, I am a satisfied customer.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are trash to put it simply. The sound quality is not as good as I thought it would be. I had the original beats the they first came out and those were so much better in terms of sound and product quality. I was really excited about these but ended up very disappointed. I'm returning them for my money back. Not at all impressed.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Beats are the best. The sound and quality is amazing and they last forever. I charged them once and they lasted for more than 2 weeks using at least 3hrs a day... very surprising,5.0 out of 5 stars
Purchased the headphones April 2017. By April 2018 the cover on the headphones started to come off. I contacted Apple to repair but they said it would cost $130 to repair because I was out of the one year warranty. now the entire ear muff has come off. I would suggest get an extended warranty if you are going to buy these are buy another product.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Worked fine with apple watch at the gym every day for 5 months. then one day they acted like they had no battery life; wouldn't turn on. followed Dr Dre Beat website instructions for resetting them, but I all I could get is the power led on (white) and a one red led.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"I got these a few days ago and they were perfect, I had a long debate on whether I should get the Bose headphones or these Beats. The Beats won out. However after only a few days of ownership they are already malfunctioning. On two separate occasions while working out at the gym the volume levels would change on their own. Which doesn’t seem too bad I guess But considering these headphones are over $200 I was hoping for a good quality product. I am currently waiting on replacements and fingers crossed this doesn’t happen again otherwise I guess I will just go for the Bose.

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless headphones and bought the Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones yesterday. I did a side by side comparison and I gotta say, the Solo 3's sound better.... way better. I know Beats are geared more toward a the low end of the sound spectrum, but I played Hip Hop, Classical, Country, Rock and some Acapela. Every test had the Solo 3's as the clear winner. Even down to the sound isolation, and the Studios have ""noise cancellation"".

There's only one negative, it is the carrying case. Could they not make it a tad bigger?! I feel like just one more centimeter of room would have shaved at least 3 minutes off putting them in the bag. ;)

I have to be transparent, I got these for $210 on another large retailer's site (think the rain forest). Would I pay 300 plus tax? Probably, but the point is, you can't find them for less, just make sure the place you're buying them from is legit.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Heads-up - this is a lengthy review - but when you are considering a headphone at this price you deserve as much review as you can get to help you decide! I will rate by topic so you can also focus on what is most important to you. Let's start with context. These are my first Beats headphones - wired or wireless. They are not of course my first wireless or wired headphones. I have several wireless headphones including Jabra Move and Jaybird BlueBuds X. I also have several wired headphones with my favorites being KEF M500 (on ear) and Oppo PM-2 (over ear). My sound preference in a headphone is crisp and clear highs and mids with a presence and ""definition"" of bass - but not over done. Yea, I'm not a bass-head. So here we go...

WIRELESS (5 / 5):
Right off the bat, this is where these headphone excel, and why I considered and bought them in the first place. They are by far the easiest bluetooth headphones I have used to pair and manage with multiple devices. This of course assumes you are very deep in the Apple eco-system - which I am. I use these headphones with an iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Initial pairing was simple and automatic with my iPhone - place it next to it, turned it on, hit accept and done. Then in seconds the headphone showed up in all my Apple devices! And switching between what device is connected and active is just as easy. I could never get previous wireless headphones I owned to play nice with multiple devices even though they supposedly supported this feature. One wireless headphone always went back and forth between my iPhone and iPad even when I was in the middle of listening to music on my iPhone. Not so with the Solo3! And the range and battery life are incredible. I have owned my Solo3 for over a week and I am still on the initial charge. So hands down wireless performance is the best feature of these headphones.

COMFORT (4 / 5):
The Solo3 is an on-ear headphone and for me they are actually quite comfortable. The leather pads are comfortable and seal well - though they are not as soft as the pads on my KEFs. But maybe they will soften over time. The ""clamping"" of the Solo3 is firm and keeps the headphones very stable during moderate activity but not so tight that they bother my ears at all. The headband liner is comfortable for me too - I don't seem to have the rubbing problem some people have mentioned. And the plastic construction (see again under quality) actually has one plus in that it keeps the headphones light. I almost don't notice they are on my head until... The good seal and firm/thick pads cause my ears to heat up after about 30 mins so I do have to take them off for short ""cool-down"" breaks.

QUALITY (3 / 5):
This is a hard one to judge short term so my rating here is certainly preliminary. Bottom line - admittedly there is a lot of plastic here. Yes, it is a plus under comfort as it keeps the headphones light. But when you get in to this price range you defiantly see more metals and leathers and less plastic. And some wired headphones I have are so solid they have lasted me over a decade! I am not sure I will be able to say that about these headphones. And a 1 year warranty is not very confident - some headphones starting at this price point offer up to 3 years. It would certainly inspire confidence if Beats backed these a bit more and made me feel like the plastic construction was solid and truly there for comfort (weight). That said its too early to bash longevity yet.

SOUND (4 / 5):
Ok now the final and most subjective topic - the sound quality. Recall my sound preference - not a bass-head. When I first heard about these headphones with the new wireless chip - I was interested because of all the hassles I had before with bluetooth headphones. But because they were Beats I struggled to decide to purchase or not. I have not owned Beats because Beats headphones I listened to in the past were definitely too much bass for me - thudding and muffled. But I decided to give it a try - I could always return them. They are not going back! The sound is actually a pleasant surprise. Yes, they are more bass then what I own now - but they sound more balanced then what I remember. You can hear good mids and highs - though they are certainly more reserved. And the spatial separation is very good - these give a full and well spaced sound that makes you feel like you are indeed in the middle of the studio or concert. They excel with more Rock then Classical, so there still is a place for my wired headphones, but I also don't feel like I have to sacrifice sound quality to get wireless convenience.

OVERALL (4 / 5):
Overall, these are very good wireless headphones - they are now my primary go to wireless headphones for sound quality and convenience across all my Apple devices - though I am keeping my set of wireless Jaybirds for intense workouts only. They are even what I turn to now over my wired headphones for most music/podcasts unless I want to immerse myself in some Acoustic, Classical or Jazz where I still prefer my wired options. Value is good - plastic to price ratio is not ideal - but it is offset by the wireless simplicity and sound. If you want a no-compromise wireless experience, you should at least consider these headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars
At this point I have had the headphones 4 months and now they won't connect to Bluetooth. I also tried to connect them to a PC for an update but they will not connect via USB. I have tried to reset the headphones but that didn't work either. In contact with Apple Support now. This is my second pair of Beats and the other ones had to be sent in to be repaired because the right side stopped working.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I got these headphones 4 months ago and for the first two months, the were great. A couple of months in, I started to have some connectivity issues and the earpads started separating from the base. Then the rubber headband started to come off.
Finally, a couple of days ago, the headphones died completely. I charged them to 100% and the still won't turn on. I bought wireless Sol Republic headphones a couple of years ago and they worked fine until I lost them and had to buy new headphones. I got these Beats thinking they'd be an upgrade.... They're cheaply made sold at a ridiculous price. NOT AT ALL WITH THE MONEY. THEY ONLY LASTED FOUR MONTHS!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Hey, So I'm writing my review on 7/18/19. I just received my beats solo 3's in the mail, and I ordered the matte black version. I read the previous comments that stated that people got fake beats in the mail and that sucks. I can't speak for those people, but the pair I received is real. I watched a couple of youtube videos to validate if mine were real and they in fact were.

Just hoping this review helps in case someone read the previous reviews of this product from this seller and was having doubts. I definitely had doubts and was nervous about getting a new pair, but am definitely relieved that mine were real and new. Hope this helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"So I have had these bad boys for about 2 weeks now. Let me tell you they work great! They came in the mail brand new sealed with all the cords and case. These have been used for gym workouts and casual listening. They do become slippery when working out hard, so I would not recommend running with these. I was skeptical at first but I have bad no issues so far. Make sure to buy a hard case as well to keep them safe!! Stand by for a later update!

UPDATE:
Going on 2 months now and they are still running strong. I used them mainly for workouts, running, and plane rides. No issues that I can detect. These are worth the money!

9 month review!!! These are still amazing. No issues yet. Keep in mind these are beats and very fragile.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Be careful. These are advertised as new and sold by Amazon directly; however, when they arrived, they don't work at all. Did not pair initially, then once paired, it went back into pairing mode every 2-3 minutes and kept losing bluetooth. Would not turn on if it was not plugged in and would not do a software update. Contacted Apple for support and it turns out the serial number on the headphones do not match the serial number on the box they came in. Apple says according to the serial number on the device, they were purchased last fall and are NOT new and have already been reported as defective. I'm very angry after spending this much on headphones, I expect them to be new and defect free. Returning for a refund and will shop elsewhere.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these particilar set of headphones for my grandson on May 27,2017. He was so excited! He receieved the headphones on May 29,2017. Three weeks ago the headphones broke . I told him it would be no problem as we bought the Square Trade insurance. Imagine my surprise to find out there was no insurance, In my grandson’s excitement he may not have done so. Nevertheless these expensive headphones should not break in four months time. I saw on order site that there was no restution for this product as the allotted time had expired.
The outcome of the product has really bothered me. Thus this email. I want to warm people against buying these particular set of headphones especially with the Holiday season around the corner. My grandson is almost 15 years old and is a responsible boy with expensive “toys”. $200+ is a lot of money to end up throwing away.

"So sad, I really wanted to like these. I used to love Beats.
The GOOD - And as far as looks go, the are fabulous - I got the rose gold & they are one of the only headphone that I actual feel fashionable wearing.
And they fit my ‘girly’ head; meaning that almost all great headphones seem to be made for guys. Why is that?! Don’t girls want the fabulous sounding headphones too (rhetorical question). Thus these fit comfortably AND they don’t look like I’m about to pilot a helicopter, mow the lawn or on the tarmac directing airplanes.
To repeat - this look and feel awesome!!
Now the BAD - the sound quality is lame. What happened Beats?? Dre?
I’m guessing that these are made to appeal to a wide variety of listening tastes.
Yes, they are probably better than most headphones made for general call/cell phone use.
Oh also GOOD - they pair flawlessly with my iPhone 7. Easy as pie to set up. And they auto connect perfectly. Also, they seem to have a better than most headphones length of Bluetooth connection.
But I must go back to my original point - the bass and over all rich quality of sold is totally lacking. It’s not horrible but it’s like listening to music “lite”, good but not great. Kinda like eating fat frozen yogurt, it isn’t bad, but is it it Haagen-Dazs... not even close",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are not made for anyone looking to seriously exercise in them. After 6 months the fake leather covering the ear pieces came off from sweat and that is even with beats protectors on. It’s now June 2018, so they two month out of the one year warranty and they simply snapped in half when I was taking them off at the gym. I keep them in a hard shell case, not rough on them. They simply feel apart from exposure to sweat during workouts. I’m very VERY disappointed",2.0 out of 5 stars

"When they worked, the sound quality was good, and it didn’t take long to charge. I bought them in August (gave them to my daughter in September for her birthday), and the mic cord came apart almost immediately - the mic cover came off). By January 1st, one side didn’t work. We’d gotten her a set of wired Beats a few years ago, and she treated them very well. The leather wore out around the ears, but there wasn’t a scratch, and she insisted they were still perfect. Because she was so good with them and used them so much, we surprised her with these wireless ones. The problems with the mic and one side were not caused by damage. The glossy finish is still in perfect condition, and she is meticulous with her things. I’m just so disappointed in the quality. The wired ones we bought a few years ago (3 sets) still work; so I guess we won’t be upgrading to wireless anytime soon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"RETURNING!!!! I opened the box and the first thing I noticed was that the headphone case was cheap. I own a pair of the Solo 2 and the case is nice soft material. This feels like a cheap backpack from the dollar store. The biggest problem was the Bluetooth. I would connect to my phone and after only 5 seconds it would disconnect every time, even when I stayed close to my phone it still disconnected within seconds, after trying over 10 times, with 4/5 battery life. I am very disappointed in the company who sent me this junk. Never buying from these people again. Buy from Best Buy. I just saw that they are $10 cheaper, and more trust worthy, straight from the store. 1/10, 0/10 if I could. Buyers Beware!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Beats Solo3 is not the best audio out there, but the crazy thing is that I find myself wearing them more often than another $500 pair of headphones that I have just because they are so convenient and easy. They fold up small and are easy to carry in a backpack, holding up well to pretty tough treatment. The battery lasts forever and if it does die, you can get a whole study session of juice for like 5 minutes of charging. Connecting to my MacBook, iPhone, or iPad is so easy using the M1 chip and the syncing of settings through iCloud that it makes connecting other bluetooth devices seem super cumbersome: Just turn the Solo3 and choose it from your list of devices (no need to disconnect from one device before connecting to the next). And finally, they look good and are very comfortable.

So even though they aren't the best headphones I own, they end up being the ones I use the most because of how convenient, tough, long-lasting, and easy they are. Even though I said the sound isn't the best, the sound is great. The only time that I can discern that they are inferior is head-to-head, and even then, for some types of music these are preferred. They are certainly tuned to handle bass quite well, but they aren't overly bass-heavy as some other reviews indicate. So the sound is more than passable, quite good, and even superior for some music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"A lot of people always seem to nitpick about about the items that they purchase off of Amazon. They always talk about how the sound quality could have been better, they always somehow find a reason that they think it's good enough to complain about the comfortability. Here's what I think about the beats that I bought:

They are one of the best headphones a person can ask for. I do not understand why people tend to complain about the comfortability when they have cushions for your ears. That's what's really important when it comes to wearing headphones that goes over your head. The sound quality is exactly what you would expect from a popular company. The sound quality is amazing along with the different colors that you can buy. When I first bought my headphones I had a question mark over my head because it wasn't turning on, but that was only because it needed to be charged. And that is the beauty of Beats Solo 3, if your headphones is dead, you can also still play music with the wires, just simply plug it in your phone and in your Beats.
I do not know if it is just me because due to the fact that I lost my other pair of Beats it's been such a long time since I touched it let alone wear it, they do seem to feel fragile, all the more reason to place a warranty on an item that happens to feel fragile. Now the question that everybody seems to be asking is ""is it true that it only takes about 5 minutes to charge the headphones completely, and is it true that the battery life last up to 40 hours."" Well the answer depends on how much you use your headphones. There is 5 LED lights that indicates the percentage of your battery of the headphones. If the LED light is on the third light, that just means that you are at least 50 to 75% of battery life left so in other words, it would take a roughly 5 to 10 minutes to charge it which isn't bad. But ultimately it is pretty fast when it comes to charging headphones especially when it turns out to be Wireless. The volume button Works along with the pause and play button, the button that turns on the wireless headphones work. It even makes that musical noise when you are officially connected to your device, and it does it again when you turn it off. I am able to extend the headphones. I am able to fold them which is a definitely a must for me because when I am finished with my headphones for the day I usually fold them.

In conclusion, if something happens to your headphone such as a shortage on the right or left side of the headphones, if you have a warranty all you have to do is just call Apple and they should be able to fix it either call Apple or whatever warranty you are affiliated with. In addition, if you have a computer or a laptop you should download this beat app where you able to update the headphones, I will not go into details but you could always look it up on your spare time. With that being said I'm giving this product and five star and whoever purchase it in the future, I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy what you bought. Not to mention that this was on sale because originally it was $300. Now in the beginning of my review I was talking about how people tend to nitpick and and complain about things that can be easily fixed. And I was very serious about that, they are the ones who bought the item off of Amazon if something happens to that item it doesn't take as much to file a complain and get a refund and get your money back after you give them back what has been broken. Since a lot of people gave it a one-star, I had to double think about me buying this. But when I purchased it it turns out to be great just as I was expecting, no issues to the point where I would want a refund.

Oh and by the way, the true difference between Beats Solo 3 wireless and Studio 3 is that studio 3 have the ability to cancel out noise, solo 3 although you are able to increase your volume the point where you are not able to hear a single thing from the outside world, there is still a chance where despite your volume being all the way up the environment that is around you could be louder than your music. So it is not fully a noise cancellation headphones. But these headphones are beneficial for me because I'm not always in an environment that is loud enough to where I have to blast it up to 100.

And this is where my review ends",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Audio quality is amazing and the design is, of course, slick. However this is the second time I've made a Beats purchase, and I've decided I won't be purchasing anymore of their products. Maybe it's because I use headphones so much, but with both products, they lasted less than half a year before something went wrong. In this case, the cushion was coming apart, and I was having trouble connecting with my laptop several times. Sometimes it would disconnect out of the blue and I would have to restart my laptop to get it to connect again. They weren't very comfortable on my ears either, so I think I'd prefer an over-the-ear headphones because this one squishes down on mine. It's a shame because the audio really is amazing! And I love the design and color, but for this price, it's not worth buying, at least not for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Got 2 pairs at once for me and my girlfriend who use them all the time with our iPhones. I have an iPhone 7 and she has an iPhone 6. I love the new pairing tech apple has in the iPhone 7's and up and these headphones are just great. You can use wires if you want to, which I think maybe makes the base a little better, though I am not sure how accurate that is. Either way, I LOVE THESE headphones! One thing I am surprised about is the battery life on these things. I charge them once a week and often fall asleep with them on Audible and wake up to them still playing all night and still only charge about once a week. The battery life is amazing, the range is amazing, the weight and design, packaging and comfort is just all top notch. I thought the battery life might be due to the W1 chip in my iphone 7 which uses the same tech as the Air Buds, but my girlfriend who uses regular bluetooth with her iPhone 6 reports the same ridiculous battery life. She also says that she charges hers once or twice a week. These are easily the most comfortable beats thus far for over the ear. Head fatigue is almost non existent.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Item arrived on time and well packaged. This was my first ever Beats product and I absolutely love it. These headphones are much better in my opinion than either the Bose noise cancelling headphones or the Jabra headphones I have used in the past. Excellent sound with rich bass and easy to use functions. As others have mentioned these headphones do have a deep bass sound which I think is great. The re-chargebale battery is wonderful and I still have not had to charge them after a month of a fair amount of use. They even fold up to put into the little storage bag that comes with them. These headphones work particularly well with my Apple devices as there is an Apple wireless chip in them. These are great mid-range headphones for a fair price. Quite frankly, these are the best headphones I have ever had. I highly recommend them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Just a heads up, these are knock offs. Pieces were falling apart the second I opened the box so that was my original reason I started the return process. I had no experience with beats so after I decided to return them because they were falling apart I went to Best Buy and tried on a pair, when then I realized they were not the same thing at all. I’m really surprised amazon is allowing this. I didn’t believe the other reviews, I thought they had some accidental fluke. Nope, they’re completely fake and very cheap bad plastic. Save your money and your time. $20 ear buds would be a wiser purchase, or save a little more and buy the real thing.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound was good, but the ear piece part was small for my taste. It put a lot of pressure on the outside of my ears...it wasn't super comfortable. If you have large ears, you may want to try them on first. But sound wise, they were great.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Let me start by saying that I got Beats after they lowered the price to $150 (I think they were $300 or something like that before September 2019). If I had to pay $300 I'd probably send them back and try some other brands known for the sound quality (Bose, Sony). Anyway, for $150 I'm pretty happy with the purchase.
First of all, they are very stylish. If you're looking for a product with a cool design, you won't be disappointed. I personally like the way they look and it feels good to have them on. Beats are easily adjustable, not too heavy, overall they fit pretty well.
It's super easy to connect them to all Apple devices. iPhone, iPad, MacBook, you name it. I connect them to a few different devices and never have any issues.
Unfortunately, the sound is not that great. It's not bad but I personally don't see any difference between beats and regular AirPods. I was expecting more for $300 headphones. Also, I don't recommend using beats when you work out and move a lot (running, jumping, cardio exercises). Other than that I have nothing to complain about. I think they are worth $150 but this review would be way different if the price was 2x higher.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are great! They are authentic and come in the original packaging. I use them mostly to study (I listen to static noise) and I wear them during my runs. They fit a little snug, but that may be because I have a large head. They feel most comfortable without my glasses and earrings.
When I listen to music the sound quality is amazing. I put them on when I am cooking and it really puts me in the groove. My chef skills have definitely been enhanced following the purchase of these headphones. If you can't cook, buy Beats for some good eats!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This purchase was a part of my rookie intro into headphones. I travel about 80% of the time with my job, airborne, and was having a hard time finding headphones that were both compact and functional. I bought these on a whim during Amazon prime day - since they were on sale - and only wore them a handful of times. They are nice and have good sound quality, but after only 30 minutes of use, start to REALLY hurt your ears... Especially since they sit right on top of your ears. To put it into perspective - I am a petite framed female with normal to small ears. I imagine if they are uncomfortable on me (5’2 / Small oval shaped head) they would certainly be uncomfortable on most people. I ended up purchasing Bose QuietComfort 35. The price point hurt, but holy %*!@ has it been worth it. I can wear my Bose headphones all day (literally) with zero discomfort. Plus, you can remotely manage them with their app. My advice - spend the extra money and buy something else. Even my cheap pair of Sony headphones were more comfortable than the Beats. Not hating - hoping this helps.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Like many others, I read the reviews of all products and filter out the reviews I feel are retaliatory or based on a shipping/seller problem verses a product issue. BUT, in this case my biggest and only issue with the Beats Solo3 is the product! It's made from cheap materials and not as impressive as the marketing campaign that launched the Beats brand. They are made of flimsy plastic, the ear cushions are made of foam and pleather that becomes oily, have fit issues, fiction and performance problems and the additional heat they generate around your ears is astonishing (maybe i should use these while snowboarding)! I've had mine for 5 months and shocked on how many issues I've had so far. Some background, I buy A LOT of items through Amazon and other retailers (some people might say I have a problem, I say I have my PhD) and this one of the worst purchases I've made! Issues I've experienced so far include; won't charge, won't turn on, won't turn off, Bluetooth not connecting to an iPhone or the car, pleather ear covering ripped on the left ear, plastic sleeve housing left speaker broke and now held together with rubber bands (about to upgrade them to electrical tape though 👍🏼) now the entire left ear housing has broken and will also get the electrical tape treatment. DO NOT waste your money or PLEASE go into a store so you can see them for yourselves and you'll be prepared for what your getting. I wish I could still return mine......procrastination gets you every time!!!

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I used to have the Solo 2 wired beats and, after many cable replacements, I figured an upgrade to the wireless would be my solution. After nearly a year without beats, considering my stubborn self didn't want to pay for yet another replacement cable, getting back to these was like heaven. They sound absolutely amazing, providing a wide range and and depth in the music. I barely put them up past half the volume and am just stunned by the quality. Even though the Solo 2 were already fantastic, they truly outdid themselves on the Solo 3.

My only issue, which I'm unsure if it's an issue for everyone or just me, is that the clip for the bag and accessories was rather loose and did not close correctly. This caused me to lose all of my accessories and the bag. Luckily I had been wearing the beats at the time so I didn't lose those but I was incredibly upset that I could have and did lose some stuff. However, Amazon support was great and solved the problem quickly.

All in all, I really love these headphones so much. They have a great feel and sound and the ability to go cordless is such a fantastic feeling.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these headsets to replace a set of in ear headsets (Mpow) that just never quite were satisfactory for use at the gym and for general use. Never thought an over the ear product would work for me until I read the reviews on these Beats Solo 3 by Dr. Dre. So I had to try them.
This is my initial unsolicited review after about a week. I have the matte black color, which sometimes Amazon varies in price to drive choice. I got mine at a good time, though- Cyber sales- so it was a very competitive price.
What did I expect going in? Before I opened the box (quite a package, if you're into that sort of thing!) had good confidence that the bass sound quality would be outstanding from reputation of the Dr. Dre Beats brand. Rewarded in that regard and many other aspects as well.
Besides that though, there is a wired connection cable, and a charging cable packed inside and all the 'foo-foo' packaging you might expect from Apple, just to mention accessories you might expect.
I'm going to concentrate on what most people buy a headset for. So let's get on to the important stuff:
• Sound quality. It's unlike and greater than 90% of the headsets I have used. As an audio engineer (my past life) I have used plenty. The size of the cups is not an unusual one if you wear a lot of headsets- just over the ear as opposed a full surround, found I prefer this style these days.
• Great build quality/design of the ear cups. Fit well and very comfortable. I can easily wear for an hour at a time. After that, they begin to feel warm-ish (read I want to take them off for awhile). Most of my wear is inside the gym, haven't gone outside for a run with them, may be different impression.
• Outstanding battery life. I got them at what appeared to be 100%, apparently they weren't though. On my iPhone (11 Pro) when I looked, the power read 50%. SO I thought to run them down to the ground. I put them on days later and it read 25%. Used further for a work out for 1.5 hours and still good (20%). Gave up and recharged 'em. I will report back on a running time after full charge.
• Isolation. An over ear headphone has MUCH BETTER isolation from external sound by it's nature of the cups surrounding the ear. I my opinion these headsets DO NOT need further noise cancellation, with the possible exception of air travel. Further noise cancellation would likely affect sound quality. Have not tried the noise cancellation version which is MUCH more expensive. I have a pair of Sony noise cancelling over-the-ear type headsets for travel that do not sound as good as these but cancel plane noise VERY WELL. The thing is, they don't sound as good.
• Controls and pairing to several devices. Bluetooth is flawless and fast to pair to new devices (admittedly all Apple). Controls on the headset (pause-play,volume up/down) are VERY responsive. I did find that going from one device paired to another always requires that the second pairing be connected at the device again. The headset want to stay paired to the original device until a new device is paired. Once you have that concept it's easy to switch between sources.
• Microphone on a call sounds great to the caller and the caller sounds great in the headsets. I don't know where the mic is exactly but wherever, it works!
Listening test. I'm listening to the headsets as I write this review. I enjoy music and my favorite sounds are nothing short of magnificent played on these headsets. My positives about that are fabulous bass (expected). My only criticism is the ""mushy"" highs. So I had to engage an equalizer to improve the highs for me. On Music app you can fool with the settings. I pictured what works for me and I admit to some hearing loss, so what it means to you is only that there is no actual reproduction of ultra low bass (<30-40Hz, I'm guessing) or ultrahigh frequencies (>12KHz), which I think is to be expected on these type headphones. What is there is fairly well flat but could use boosting (again for me) and tweaking in the mid-range high frequencies. I feel that resulted in a major improvement. In my case with known music as the source and still with a bit of bass coloration, I found a sweet spot, to EQ settings as shown in the picture.
Review conclusion. An outstanding quality product! If there 4.75 stars I would give it that overall rating. Actual Rating. I'm taking off 1 star overall for less than perfect sound, likewise the bass quality because it was too overpowering out of the box and affected the frequency response. Apple knows something about audio and many folks will disagree with me. OK. My fix was minor on the computer source. However the fix for iDevices is not as easy, though I'm betting there is an app for that or soon will be because it's worth doing.
I may just get that app and use it, because these headsets are a pleasure to wear and use.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love these headphones, we will buy another Beats Solo3 next month after we save up. A bit spendy as compared to Sony 950 set that we returned last week, but absolutely night and day difference in sound quality. The Sony set had superb bass, but there was a trade off as treble and midrange suffered quite a bit (lacking). These Solo3 have a very balanced and deep bass, as well as detailed midrange and treble. Probably the treble was a tiny bit lacking, but full treble can be harsh I have found. I was thinking my Planetronics Backbeat did better with overall sound but after listening to them again to compare, I found the Solo3 has the mid and highs covered better as it takes the ""harshness"" out of a lot of it. Kind of cuts off the harshness of not only the treble and mids, but also the bass . No overpowering bass, but totally enough to make me happy . Listen to a lot of dubstep, and these are very pleasant sounding with that genre of music !!

Folding them up to put in the carry case didn't feel like I was going to break them, which I was worried about before I purchased. For the price they can not be beat, very happy (oh did I say that already) ? lol",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Update January 18 2019
After having to have my beats replaced FIVE times in less than a year, a person in a higher position talked to me. He made sure I got a new pair of headphones AND a new warranty. I did send them in for a replacement two days ago, because the ear coverings had started coming off again and would not stay in with the card trick. So I had that done while it was under warranty. I know that these beats won’t last forever, I am currently seeking a better alternative for when that happens.

Let me first say, I love my beats. The sound is much better than the past beats headphones. But the build quality is horrible. I knew they didn’t have the best build, but the fact that I’ve had to have my solo 3’s replaced twice in less than a year is absolutely ridiculous. I take very good care of my headphones, I’m not rough with them at all. These are way too expensive for the quality you’re getting. At least apple has been helpful.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited a year to post a review as I wanted to see if they would last. Yes the sound is great. Yes the noise reduction is wonderful, but if they only last a year, they are not worth the price! I've seen comment after comment from Beats owners that after a year or less couldn't hear sound from one side. To have them repaired is $129. There are you tube videos showing you how to tear apart the faltering side and pull wires, solder and put it back together, but if you don't have the skill set, you're stuck with Beats that only have sound in one ear. Get a less expensive pair of headphones. You'll be so much happier if they break and you are not out $229",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I rearrange my home office recently. This office is my primary workplace. In the rearrangement, my computer hutch and my desk are on opposite walls. As I moved back and forth my old standby Grado SR60 cans ended up pulling out of the headphone jack or worse pulling the computer on the floor. I was looking at the Beasts solo 3 wireless as they seemed very similar to the Grados. The price was right on Prime day.

These are on ear cans so I don't expect perfect noise cancellation. That said the experience is better than expected. The sound excellent and very transparent. I can go from bass heavy rock to string quartets without needing adjustments. Wearing duration is very good, with two to three hours with fatigue. Learned not to bend too far forward or the headphones will fall off. Bonus finding, these headphones are very good for phone calls. I was listening when paired to my iPhone when I had a phone consultation. I forgot I was wearing the beats and when I realized I did not make the switch to my usual phone headset I asked about my voice clarity. I was told the call was very clear.
Finally, the pairing to my MacBook Pro and iPhone was very easy and switching between devices is just a matter of going the menu on the device I want use and selecting the Beats.

For the environment when I use these headphones they are exactly what I want. There tendency to slip off when bending and noise leakage make them a poor choice when I am woodworking.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I kicked around the idea of buying these after I got my iPhone X, which lacks an earphone jack. At first I didn't want to spend another couple hundred dollars after I'd just spent $1200 on the phone, but I bought these on impulse while waiting for a delayed flight last weekend. I am really happy I did. I didn't read any of the reviews until after I'd made the purchase so I was concerned for....say, 30 seconds that I'd get a fake. But let me say with absolute certainty: THESE ARE REAL. I feel bad for people who ended up with knock-offs, but I got what I paid for.

This is actually my second pair of Beats, since I've had the ""sport"" version for several years. No, those ones did not wear out - they're still going strong for four years now, but I got them to wear while training for marathons and running on the road where I wanted to be very aware of traffic and my surroundings. Since then, I've migrated more to lifting and wanted headphones that would block out outside noise and let me get into my zone uninterrupted. As a gal lifting by herself, the chatter from the ""bros"" on the weight floor is still a little intimidating to me but these Beats do just the trick to help me tune that out, pay attention to only what I am doing, but still have enough awareness of what's going on around me so that I'm not the rude one who looks like she can't share space and the equipment.

The battery life is much longer than I expected and probably does approach 40 hrs like the product description says. They came fully charged and I first used them on a Monday and think I probably didn't actually turn them off but the battery still had juice when I picked them back up on Wednesday. They are a little heavier than I expected, but still very comfortable. I am not a musician and can't weigh in on the nuances of sound quality, but I can say that my music sounds phenomenal in these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these headphones exactly two years ago today. They now experience random disconnecting and won't repair to an already paired iDevice. At first, these were awesome! The pairing experience with an iDevice is so fluid and seamless. Pairing it to any of your other iCloud-connected devices is so easy. I went from my iPhone to my iPad to my Apple TV all in a day. The battery life is also amazing. I think I went 4 months without charging it at one point. Fast forward to today and I am really disappointed. My Solo 3s started to disconnect in the middle of songs and it wouldn't repair. I tried everything, even resetting the device and forgetting it on my iPhone. That worked at first but that solution would only last a day. I contacted Apple Support and they offered to replace it for $129 plus tax. Now that sounds like a good deal at first, but consider that I already spent $300 on these 2 years ago. I expect these headphones to last at least 5 years. And I took great care of these headphones, they were never exposed to water, and I never worked out with them (they aren't water resistant!). I think I am done with Beats, and instead, I will now take my $129 plus tax and use it towards the purchase of a Bose or Sony headphones.

Apple informs me that the ""purchase date"" was more than 60 days (in fact is was 120 days prior to my purchase date). Further, trying to get a US representative is nearly impossible. Instead you are placed on hold for more than thirty minutes only to once again being connected to a off-shore representative.

"Not at all worth your $300. Seriously I would not consider purchasing these ever again, especially after the lack of support I received from Apple on them.

I purchased these originally in November of 2017. In June of 2018 I had an issue where audio stopped working completely with one of the ears (I can't remember if it was the right ear or the left ear). I brought them into the Apple Store they looked them over and determined they could be sent in. About 10 days later I received the headphones in the mail, but it was never clear if they were mine or a replacement pair that I got back (if they weren't mine, why did it take so long, why not just give me a new pair right there in the store?).

Fast forward to now, May 2019. I'm having the same exact issue. The audio in the right ear has stopped working. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps they ask you to perform (try on multiple devices, try with the cable connecting it to a device, reset the headphones, etc.). I brought them into the Apple Store, this time I'm told that my only option is to pay $129 for a replacement pair. Apple will sell you a new pair (with only a 90 day warranty) for $129 since you previously purchased this product.

Apparently the original product has a 1 year warranty on it. The replacement/repaired product has a 90 day warranty or whatever is left on your original warranty, whichever one is longer. So at this point I'm outside that window. I connected with Apple Support today, this time online, to go through the same process to see if I could find any other solutions. Same result, I can purchase the replacements for $129 which will only have a 90 day warranty on them.

So two pair of these headphones got me from November 2017 to May 2019, a total of 18 months. I'm not sure how Apple can justify that it's alright for $300 headphones to be completely worthless after a total of 18 months. Considering I had two pair, so they seem to really last roughly 9 months. I will never buy another Beats product again and I'm disappointed that I already own so many other Apple products :(.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Both my beats solo 2 and 3 stopped working between 12-18 moths. Same issue with the right earphone losing hearing without being dropped, mistreated, or abused. The first I assumed was a defect. Having it happen again, I’m convinced it’s designed with a flaw to force upgrades and stimulate purchases. Contacted apple support and after shipping both out at a cost of $130 each to repair, they refused and simply told me to purchase new ones. Poor product and even worse customer service from apple. Bought the Bose qc 3 in the hope that with spending $350, the products quality will mesh with the price better than Beats cheaply made product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these for my son in May 2018. He LOVED them until the right side quit playing. We contacted Apple since we were within the one year warranty time frame and they informed us that the serial number has been activated in December of 2017, so the warranty was already expired. Without the warranty they want 3/4 of the cost of a new pair to fix. We’re VERY upset that this is how we found out. Apple told us that sometimes other people sell returned items...which makes us out of luck.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I was hesitant to spend so much money on a pair of headphones. I've always just used the headphones that came with my iPhone. Now that the iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack in the phone, I've been looking for wireless ones so I wouldn't have to search for the little adapter. After listening to music with these headphones I realized what a difference quality headphones make. I got the glossy white and they are really pretty (which is a weird thing to say about headphones.) I'm really glad I made the investment :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I believe these are the real thing and the packaging was perfect. They paired up perfect to my ipod but I don't know if they were defective but the volume is pathetic even at full volume... I can barely hear the music but I can hear everything else! Kinda bummed because I had heard some great things about them. They're beautiful and well made but my cheap wire earbuds that I was replacing blow them away... I'm glad I kept my cheap earbuds.

Now I'll go to maybe a Bluetooth earbud or wire system... Just something that has volume so I don't hear all the noise going on when I workout. Just want to hear the music and not what the people next to me are saying. So if you want volume and music when you're working out... You don't want these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Let me start with a couple things. 1) my phone that I use these headphones with is a galaxy note 8. 2) this is my first purchase of any set of headphones that cost more than 40 dollars so high end by my standards.
With that out of the way these are not all I was expecting for such a highly known brand. I have a pair of in ear wireless headphones with what seem to me about the same sound quality and for a tenth of the price. (They are 20 bucks). These are significantly better at noise cancelling which I can appreciate. However some things I have problems with besides the quality of sound is they are tolerable to wear for a period of time with glasses but after that period they can start causing a headache and just be extremely uncomfortable. With that said they do hold secure to my head and don't really move unless I'm moving my head a lot. I've been using them on and off for 3 days now and still haven't charged them (and they came with only a half charge at that) which is incredible to me. The other problem I have is it is extremely catered to Apple I believe. When in Bluetooth mode I had a difficult time connecting even with instructions, the volume up and down/ play pause button is a hit and miss whether it wants to work or not, and trying to go back a song does not work at all. It usually just skips 3 or 4 songs ahead. When it is connected via the wire the button on the wire is useless unless I need to pause and play. The volume buttons do not work and i cannot skip or go back songs. The final problem I had is the case. It is very limited in space which I can appreciate for on the go and packing in my backpack. However getting them into it's case can be much harder than is required.
With that being said, I do actually like these headphones and will keep them. They are a good pair of headphones. The negatives I've included have primarily been the biggest problems that I've run into.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"So i thought i had something wrong with my ears but nope it's the headphones. I've been wearing all kinds of headphones for long periods of time and I've never experienced headphones that would pinch your ears and give you an ear ache that you can't rest your head on the pillow because it's too painful. I've lost sleep, work concentration and money over these. Sound quality is better than other headphones I've used but none of those $40 headphones have ever made me loose sleep. Now I can't return them after using them for one month.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I realize that these are not inexpensive headphones. I wanted really decent headphones that had a really large bass response. Beats are known for their quality and so that's what I was looking for. Fast charging that will last for a long time, meaning that I only seem to need to charge it every few days, and I use it a lot. Also very beautiful. It has invisible controls on one side of the headset, meaning that if you press one of the sides things will happen, like volume control, and most importantly, if push twice it will skip to the next song depending on how you have your source music set. I have mine set to play randomly so I don't know what is playing next. That is controlled by your unit, not the headphones. These are Bluetooth headphones and you can hook them up to anything that Bluetooth's. It also has an incredible range on it. This is my second apartment I have had them at and it actually goes perfectly from floor to floor right through the cement without sound deterioration of any kind. No I don't know what the range is, and so it may depend on your own situation, but I simply do not think that there are better headphones out there for the price. Like I said, if you are looking for excellent bass response, and I like bass, because I listen to a lot of rock 'n roll and heavy metal, then these headphones are the right ones to get. They are also very sturdy and they fold up so if need be you can put them in your coat pocket. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had these since August 2017 and I loved them but I've noticed in the last few months, they don't seem as great. I feel like some songs are fuzzy suddenly and now like tonight, they just keep, for a lack of better word, stopping; the song will stop and I'll check the connection, it is still connected and the song is playing on iTunes, but there is no sound. I'll pause the song, push the little button on the headset, then push play on iTunes and they'll be fine again for a while. And then some nights I can't get them to work at all.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"So the first thing to know about Beats is that they are optimized/equalized before you buy them. You cannot equalize Beats. That's their whole selling point is that you dont need to. Now having said that the question must be asked ""is this a good thing?"" And the answer is, to some degree at least, yes. These headphones are extremely well made and durable and the sound quality is by far the best I've heard yet. The battery life is insane. They advertise a 40 hour battery life at a full charge and up to 3 hours of battery life with just 5 minutes of charging. As far as I can tell these numbers are lower than the actual battery life as on my first full charge i didnt need to charge them for almost a month all while listening to them 4+ hours a day for at least 5 days a week. The only issue with these headphones is these are really made for rap/hip hop. Now don't get me wrong, I have listened to metal, country, pop, classic rock etc on them and it still sounds extremely good, but hardcore audiophiles may not like the inability to equalize the headphones themselves. All in all these are by far the best headphones I've ever owned and definitely are worth the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones have decent sound quality for 1) bluetooth and 2) casual listening. They are on-the-ear style that come with a 3.5mm cable (for plug-in listening and full audio quality), a nifty carrying case. What I enjoy, however, is the pairing with Apple devices via their W2 chip. I recommend these for people with Apple devices (particularly if you have more than one). If you aren't an Apple user or have a mixed ecosystem, check out Sennheiser's HD series for better options.

As they are ""on-the-ear"" phones, you may experience fatigue after several hours. By that point, giving your ears a break (for any headphones) for a few minutes will be helpful.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Ladies & Gents this Review is best suited for those share the same interest in the following questions.
1) Is it Loud Enough?
Absolutely...., Beats by Dre now uses Apple Tech in their HeadPhone lines, held by Strong Standards giving you quality sound and durability......Read On-->
2) is It Worth the money ?
You pay for what you expect not for what you want... , They are Made for the Every Day User with Great Quality Materials and of Course Performance
3)Gloss Black Vs Black?
These are GlossBlack with look great they really are made of good materials and although it has a beautiful glossy black finish to it , its not that annoying super shiny 'sprinkling gloss'

I owned the previous model the Wired Solo 2's wich I did Enjoined but didn't fill my expectations on Quality ... The Solo 3's changes all that....
With High Quality Output Sound, Long Lasting Battery Life, and made of Great Quality materials you have everything you need in the box and the HeadPhones already come with a full charge ..... I gotta be completely Honest and say I have had them for half a day at the time of this review and wanted to write an informative review on my experience .... the quality of hd sound and battery life for daily use ... some up in One word AMAZING!!!....40 hours of battery life after a single charge or 3 hours after a 5 min. charge ...Great Quality Sound and what looks to be made of great lasting material .... Get!! I like the head phones not to mention how quickly it connects to your iPhone , now I also own an Apple Watch and was always pleased on the seamless experience of the bluetooth connectivity ...the Solo 3's give you the same experience ... giving cordless a new meaning.....

"The Basics -
Build quality: 8/10
Sound quality: 7/10
Comfort: 7/10
Battery: 10/10
Usability: 8/10

I'm going to start with the build quality, which I think is excellent. Everything from the packaging to the ear pads is looks and feels well constructed. The design of the headphones is also very simple, so there is not a lot of variation in texture/materials, which gives the headphones their slick and stylish look. The only thing I wasn't very impressed with was the soft shell carrying case, which is only okay. It's good for keeping the headphones from getting tangled or caught on stuff in a bag or pack but offers very little actual protection.

Sound quality: 7/10
For on-ear headphones, the sound quality is pretty good. But at the price point, there are other headphones you could get that have better sound quality. That being said, these definitely perform well and I enjoy listening to them.

Comfort: 7/10
As with pretty much any on-ear headphone, these do start to get uncomfortable to wear after a while. However, I find that I can wear them a good 2-3 hours before they start to get tiring on my ears. I also find that I rarely use them for that long, as when I'm at work or somewhere I'm sitting, I probably won't be using these. So they're great for traveling, around the yard or house, at school, etc, but probably not a primary headphone.

Battery: 10/10
The battery on these is amazing. I believe the battery is listed for 40 hours of use, and I would say that's about accurate. I have yet to have the battery die,

Usability: 8/10
The power button is small but easy to locate, the headphones connect super fast to my phone (almost instantly), and the play/skip and volume controls are accessible and easy to navigate without any thought.

Overall I've been super happy with these and would recommend them to any looking for a stylish and good sounding pair of school/travel headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are very good headphones, but for the steep price, I was a little disappointed. Main points:

1. SOUND QUALITY: This is the most important part of the experience and this is the downfall of the Solo3. The base is too overwhelming, resulting in an overall muddy sound. I was actually quite surprised at how bass heavy these were the moment I first turned them on. Mid range and tenor sound tight and crisp without flaws, but its simply a bit over weighed by the intense bass. Of course this is a subjective determination...but count me in in the ""this is too much bass"" group.

2. WEAR: These are a bit heavy, more so than an accompanying pair of wired headphones, but the weight in itself is not intrusive. The headphones fit tightly, but after some time the ear pads do slightly pinch my lower earlobes. Its not a deal breaker, but again, I was expecting something engineered flawlessly for comfort for the price.

3. CONNECTIVITY / BATTERY LIFE: Excellent coverage on these for blue tooth. I can walk almost up to 10 meters away in a different room before these start fritzing out. A huge plus is the very long battery life. As I listen to music at work non-stop, I was sick of having to recharge headphones every 5-6 hours or so. I charge these once and they last several days and into the weekend as well sometimes.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I recently re purchase beats solo 3 black hoping for a great experience. Out of the box everything was great and working without any issue. Travel to San Francisco didn’t have any issue. On my return trip back to my home state I experience charging issue with the beats solo 3 headphones where the battery would not take a charge and stayed on red. I tried different cables and used an ac to USB charger still same results. I stop by apple and they would have to send it out for two weeks I was still under 30 day purchase period and had them returned. I waited and purchase another pair recently hoping for a great experience worked great no issues until today. My headphone were charging all night with no issue 5 white lights. Went to the gym notice it was at 3 white light s strange. 1 hours of working out the headphones stop working. Stop by apple they said try to reset and charge again if issue continue they would send it out for service two weeks. Came to the office and attempted to reset and charge my beats solo 3. The unit would not charge pass 1 white light for 2 hours. There seems to be issue with beats solo 3 not sure what it could be but I will wait before purchasing again.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Beats are great when it comes to sound quality, mobility and battery life. The design is beautiful, they fold compactly and come with an aux cable so they can be used plugged in to things such as console controllers, monitors, laptops etc. The connectivity with my iPhone is great and the bluetooth range is impressive ( I was able to leave my phone on one floor of the house and go in to the basement and did not lose connection.) There are two down sides to these headphones however, the somewhat fragile folding system and the clamping weight. Basically you fold the headphones over on to themselves to store them and it seems like you can easily break them this way if you aren't careful. The clamping weight is the pressure these headphones put on your ears while they're on. After anywhere between 20-40 minutes of use, I usually have to take them off and readjust them to ease ear soreness. The heavy clamping weight helps these headphones stay on your ears however while moving around/exercising but unfortunately hurts your ears a lot.

Pros:
- Great mobility
- Great connectivity
- Great sound quality
- Great battery life

Cons:
- Fragile design
- Clamping weight (hurts ears over time)
- Price (if looking for budget headphones or if you don't get them on sale like I did)

Hope this review helps.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not an audiophile but husband is and currently own real great sounding headphones. I've got this ship n sold by amazon and it's 100% authentic and was able to register. We're not an apple household and I only bought this out of long time curiousity and it's battery life.
Coming from Sony and other high end brands, this beats is not really that special audio wise. The bass is good but it is too bass-y for my liking I find it annoying sometimes. It sounds great in upbeat songs because of heavy bass but too muddy and noisy in mellows. I am more into soul, jazz, classical, pop, country, acoustic, 70s 80s classics and the likes so this isn't my go to headphone. I cannot stand this headphone when it comes to slow songs. When I'm in a mood for some upbeat reggae then this is it.
It's overall nice quality, sound is good, just not $200 let alone 300 good. People saying this is the best in market probably never tried the really good ones out there (and it's okay). Glad I bought this at a deep sale price or I'd be crying by now. My $100 Sony & Bose sounds just as good and even better and clearer on most songs in my list. If we have same taste in music, look for something else, you'll find some with same sound quality but at a significantly lower price. And if you want to buy this, do yourself a favor, buy this on sale coz it's really not worth it's regular price. It's only worth $150 tops and that's already a stretch. If you've never owned expensive headphones and been saving $ to buy one then please look somewhere else: sony, bose, audioTec, bowers, beyerdynamic, sennheiser.
I'm keeping this not because of the sound but for my upcoming long international travel. I needed something that will survive me forever without charging since I'll be in the airport and plane for 2 days. The battery life is aweeesome- best out of all my bluetooth headphones!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are the real deal. Once I turned on the Bluetooth on my phone the Beats Solo software automatically appeared. It seamlessly connected to my Apple Watch as well. The Matte Black comes with grey lettering on top which also indicates that it is real. The sound is nice and crisp, especially with some old school Metallica. The headphones feel extremely comfortable, sturdy and light.

"It might seem harsh to ding the headphones for a software issue, but the reason you're paying a premium on these headphones is for the W1 chip, which makes it integrate better into the Apple ecosystem. If you're on android, there are better quality headphones for the price.

The W1 chip does let switching between apple devices work seamlessly, but the new iOS update (that I understand they have no intention of fixing) makes these completely unusable. I had to dismiss this popup 50 times a day whenever my headphones are near an iOS device. This happens on a device that's currently connected OR NOT. And when it's not, there's not even an option to connect. I have to dismiss this dialog in order to manually connect.

This is not a seamless experience. If I open my phone I want information quickly, I don't want to be reminded that my headphones exist. Do Not Disturb mode doesn't even and this misery.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Amazing headphones, I use them to do transcription and I am able to hear every single word without the strain or difficulties I had with previous headphones. The color is gorgeous and I love that it came with a case, cords and even a clip to put on the bag for when I'm traveling. The soft inner cushions for the ears are superb and very comfortable. I was worried that the white would be difficult to keep clean or would not look good but once I received them I saw that this would not be an issue. Controls on the headset are very easy to use, quick to connect to computer, laptop or cell phone and the sound quality is superb. I am very pleased with these amazing head phones and they truly are worth the splurge.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Overpriced. You can either buy for the beats name or spend half the amount of money and get something equal, if not better quality. These will break easily due to being made of cheap material.

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Recently purchased these and have owned them for about a month. Love them and the sound quality for the most part; however, the left half of the headphones have completely blown out without warning, so now only the right side is producing sound.

"I'm not a headphone expert and maybe I was expecting there to be a live concert in my ears but these haven't wowed me in the slightest. The ear cups are small and can get pretty uncomfortable how they sit on your ears, the sound is just ok. Not bad but like I said, I got just as good of a sound from a less expensive pair and to top it off, they pull my hair out every time I take them off. With everything considered, I wouldn't buy them again. I'm giving them to my kids and whatever happens to them, happens. I should have stayed with my less expensive brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"First review, more reviews to come the longer I wear This head set.
Wore them to the gym, they did not shift in any direction while wearing them. I wear glasses, I placed then just below my upper earlobe, no year pain after an hour in the gym.
Sound was great, kept it at 3/4 volume, was just the right level to get going, but low enough to hear if someone was trying to tell me something.
Quality feels good and durable.

"These headphones did not disappoint. There is not one bad thing I can say about them. Great quality. Great sound. I had no problem pairing them to my iPhone and MacBook. And yes, THEY ARE AUTHENTIC. I would suggest avoiding buying them from third party sellers, I believe that is why some people are receiving knockoffs. I would also suggest avoiding buying used Beats. Buy them new if you want to be sure you receive the authentic ones. For some reason the (white and gold) Beats were $30 cheaper when I bought them... they went up in price the day after I purchased them. If you happen to see them for a great deal, don't hesitate to buy them. If you're still worried about getting a knockoff, you can always price match at Best Buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones arrived today. After wearing them off and on throughout the day, I have enjoyed their quality in materials and the sound quality is great. I was worried that they'd be heavy on bass, but they're a good balance. I've listened to several genres of music and even some podcasts and the quality is consistent throughout all areas. My only complaint is that these headphones are not comfortable to wear for extended periods. After 30-45 minutes, they start to hurt becuase they put a decent amount of pressure on my ears. This is kind of a bummer because I bought these to use while doing online classes and school work.
*update*
I was working at my computer while listening to a podcast on these headphones. I had to use the restroom, I was able to walk all the way upstairs and listen to the podcast while doing business without any interruption! The distance on these things is ridiculous!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I'll start by saying I had a hard time finding genuine Beats online, if you search online you quickly learn what to look for. These were a bit less than retail, so I wondered if I'd be getting an authentic pair. It was indeed authentic (Mickey's 90th Anniversary Solo3 Beats).

The headphones are gorgeous, they make me smile. The sound is definitely fantastic. I had heard mixed comments on the Beats sound quality, but I spent this morning switching between the Beats Solo 3 and Bose QC35 and I honestly prefer the Beats sound quality. Of course, the QC 35 have perfect noise cancellation, but the Beats never claim to be noise-cancelling.

My only complain about the Solo 3 is that they are on-ear as opposed to over the ear. This means the cushions rest directly on top of your ears and I found that they became a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours of continuous use. I don't know if I'll get used to it, or the cushions will soften/adapt more to my ears. But for prolonged listening, right now, I would prefer an over-the-ear pair.

I'm overall happy with the purchase and I think most people will be too.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"As you can see I have a variety of different pairs and these are the best sounding, most comfortable pair I own. Synced easily with my iPhone, and work perfect with my Series 1 Apple Watch music controller. I wasn't worried about the sync being an issue. They are so comfy even with my 3/4 size gauges, with them being metal it doesn't push them into my neck like some headsets do. They don't slip around either. They cover my entire ear and make a nice ""seal"" I guess you could say. Literally if they are turned up even to half the max volume I can't hear anything around me. Definitely would recommend them to anyone. I got them when they were $179 had some gift cards and such so I got a great deal on them, Amazon definitely has the best prices on these keep and eye on it if you aren't looking to drop the $300.

"Obsessed!! After paying full price for these as a gift for my spouse last holiday season and listening to him brag about how awesome they were, i saw the same beats solo3 on sale during prime day. These live up to the hype, especially for less than $150! I’d been using a cheaper (yet prettier) set of over the ear headphones but they would start to feel tight after a bit, didn’t have wireless/Bluetooth option, and the sound was tinny. Now i totally get the big deal about these! They’re light weight, simple to use, the sound is AMAZING, they blocked out ambient noise like a BOSS, and are so so comfortable. Feels like pillows on your ears. Highly recommend. My hubby has used them almost daily to work out in (read: sweat like crazy) and for travel and they last!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Munson bought with his money this headphones. I have use them to test, the sound is pretty good but I don’t like the fit, they feel too tight on my head and the ear caps feel to little. They are not the big ear cover like other ones I’ve seen. I guess they are different styles I’m just saying I like the bigger ones that cover your entire ear.
I couldn’t wear it for more than 15 minutes because of the pressure on my head.
If I compare it to my BOSE I love my Bose thousand times more.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I have had these headphones for about a year. I love them. However, the leather is coming off the head phones after a little over 12 months. Hard to justify a $300 purchase when they fall apart. After googling the issue it seems like a common issue. I contacted apple and they will not do anything to help me other than offer me a replacement for $150. If that is the case, I would rather buy another brand that will hold up. It is great the sound quality and battery life is fantastic, but if they are falling apart like this, how am I supposed to use them. Seems like a bad design. I suggest googling the issue before you buy.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros
Amazing 40-hour battery life
Good, clear sound on iphone7 from all audio sources (music & other audio playback apps such as YouTube)
Decent call quality for user and caller (unsure of performance in noisy backgrounds or windy conditions)
Good volume range for audio playback and phone calls
Decent noise canceling ability without integration of electronic noise canceling technology (I think ear cups are manually designed for optimum noise canceling)
Cord with high-quality mic provided with headset
USB charging fcable included (able to use iPhone wall charger or other compatible USB wall charger to charge headset as well as charging from connection to PC)
Only 2 hours charging time for full battery life
Comfortable ear cup padding
Headset controls not flimsy and easy to operate
Unbroken long-range Bluetooth connectivity using iphone7
Steller support for software updates, Bluetooth connectivity, and support questions (Beats products are owned and supported by Apple company)
Easy setup and installation with iphone7 (unsure of performance with Mac or Windows PC)

Cons
Some notable trouble using headset to answer mobile calls as well as soft phone calls (skype, what's app, etc.)
Very tight fit (tight squeeze on head causing frequent headaches, though diminished a slight bit after frequent use)
No voice feedback when operating controls (battery life can only be determined by viewing indicator LEDS; troublesome for blind user)
Strangely, no headset battery indicator on iphone7 status bar (many other bluetooth headsets show battery status next to Bluetooth indicator on iPhone status bar)

Well, as you can see, I've experienced a mixed bag of positive and negatives in using this headset. Here are some additional observations based on my experience.

* Though I'm not an experienced audiofile, the bass seems full without distorting other sounds. I experienced enjoyable audio quality when watching TV apps, youtube videos, and listening to music.
* My main purpose for trying this headset was for phone call quality by comparing them with the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series. I did experience fairly clear feedback from callers when using the headset, but callers sometimes reported a bit of distortion from my end but it was only slight. Additionally, I had frequent occurrences where, after receiving a call, I could not answer with the headset when trying to use them to answer the call. Instead, the call was routed to the iPhone itself and I had to manually route the call to the headset.

An Interesting Experience to Note

However, the strangest anomaly occurred when using this headset. From reading reviews and talking with Apple support, I was told, definitively, that this headset does not have a built-in mic when being used wirelessly (accompanying cord does have built-in mic). However, I successfully used the headset using Bluetooth connection (not with cord) and callers could hear me with no trouble. So, I reasoned that if this Beats headset doesn't have a built-in mic, then my iphone7's mic is being used to communicate with callers. However, after moving over 100ft. from my iPhone, the callers could hear me as clearly as when I was less than 5ft. away from the iPhone. So, I really don't know how my voice is being transmitted to callers when I'm communicating wirelessly with this headset. hmmm!

* In addition to trouble in answering calls with this headset, my main beef with this Beats product is the really tight squeeze on my head. Unfortunately, this tightness was quite uncomfortable to the point where I dealt with several headaches. Though I've only had these for 3 weeks, the discomfort has only diminished slightly.

Frankly, because I find the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series to have superior call quality on both ends and to be much more comfortable than these, I will most likely return this headset though it consists of many good features such as seamless connectivity with the iPhone and amazingly high battery life.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"We got these on Black Friday which made them an excellent value. Overall, these headphones are very comfortable and above average from a sound quality standpoint. There are many cheaper options out there, many of which I have tried, but I think that these are really a step up. The other great thing about these was the iphone bluetooth integration which makes pairing very easy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
My first pair lasted less than a year before they started giving problems. Battery life started decreasing. Then the led on/off light wouldn't turn off so it began draining the battery. So sent it in to be repaired thru warranty company. Well they sent it back in worse condition. Headphones went dead after 3 days and would not recharge. I also found damage on the right earpiece that looks like it was preyed open with a flat head screwdriver. So I informed warranty company again and then called amazon. The rep from amazon was really cool. Said not to worry we are sending you a brand new pair instead. Love how amazon takes care of the problem better than aftermarket warranty company.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased the Beats for my daughter and she loves them. This is the second set of Solo3's I've purchased for her. The left speaker failed on each pair. I've done research on the internet and learned that Beats has a problem with the left speaker failing due to a small wire being pinched during production. Unknown if this is the problem with the Beats I've purchased. The second pair I sent back for repair and am still waiting for them to be returned. Apple/Beats needs to address this problem immediately. Amazon has been great with their fast response to assisting us with sending them back for repair, however we were told ten days. It's been longer than that. Thanks",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are...petite, I guess would describe it. They're on-ear, and even when extended fully the headband clamps them on to your head with a tenacity worthy of something from the first Alien movie. My ears can't take more than about 20 minutes before the aching and lack of blood circulation force me to take them off. Haven't encountered this with other on-ear headphones before - the first step in using headphones is actually leaving them on your head, and when that's not really possible, all other considerations pale in significance.

That said, the sound quality is OK, but not great. These sound better than previous Beats headphones, so Beats is definitely improving, but for the price, there are better sounding headphones. These headphones don't overemphasize bass as much as older Beats headphones did, but it's still a bass-heavy headphone. If you want to hear treble and mid-range, there are cheaper headphones that will deliver them more effectively.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a replacement my cheap $25 bluetooth headphones. What a world of difference. Every genre of music sounds fantastic. They are a bit heavy but you get used to the weight. The controls are on the side of the headphones and are easy to use. They pair very easily with Apple products and even with Android products. I found there was a bit of delay with the signal for Kindle HD 10 but I had that same problem with my old headphones. However, the trouble didn't last long. I wore the headphones on a long 2 mile walk and although my ears got warm they did not sweat profusely. I wouldn't use them for a hard workout though. I wish the ear cups were a bit bigger because while I was walking there was a bit of pressure on my ears. They are great for sitting at home and even some light housework. The range is decent but the signal will start to break up around 500 feet away. I would recommend an arm band for your phone or mp3 device if you would like to walk around the house with them and still have good signal. They reduce a lot of exterior noise so they could be good on an airplane or library.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Purchased these head phones under 2 years ago. They are in great condition. Very little use of the past 2 years. They stopped taking a charge months ago. Finally got around to contacting Apple support about the issue. The one year limited warranty did help Apple would not replace the defective Beats Solo headset. Very disappointed with their service and not willing to stand behind their products. Recently my son had a issue with wireless Bose headset. The covering came off due to wear. They too were about 2 years old and out of warranty. Bose support send him a shipping label and replaced the headset free of charge. I'm a Bose customer for life.

"I’m primarily comparing the beats I own to DNA monster headphones I purchased at sharper image. DNA put the beats to shame in sound quality, the quality of materials is equivalent, whereas the beats win in terms of battery.

Here is the problem; why in the world would beats be so popular if their sound quality lacks severely? My answer: Dre, and the fact that they are just cool and come in rose gold (in my case). The battery typically does last a Day, which I gotta say I love. The fact that they auto pair nicely with my phone is great too. I would recommend over-ear beats if you just have to spend the money tho, on ears do get uncomfortable. If I could do it over again, I would have lefts these overpriced headphones on the shelf.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"They are so tight on my head I an unable to wear or use them -- they pinch and give a terrible headache. Also, if you wear them to workout or even walk, everystep reverberates into the ears. They are awful and they won't let me return.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I’ll get to the point.

Pros:

- Noise cancellation is superb. Nothing should disturb your music sessions with these on.

- Bass is adequate. Not earth shattering but good enough for a former bass head who had 10 inch subwoofers in my old Acura :-)

- Battery life is great. Didn’t have to charge these things for days.

CONS:

- Decibels could be louder. I tried these at max volume on all of my devices and was disappointed. Max volume should have your ears ringing but not the case here.

- mid range cords and vocals are lacking.

- The case requires effort to get the headphones inside. It should be effortless.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I have no complaints! Came in original box with everything as described. I’m not a headphone connoisseur and haven’t owned any others comparable to these so I can’t speak to how they measure up to others. I had been told they were of good quality so I got them, and I have enjoyed them so far. Easy to set up, and the charge lasts a long while. If you wear them for hours on end, your ears do get kind of sore, but i would expect that for any type of headphone like this. Does a pretty good job blocking out surrounding noise. We shall see if they stand up against the test of time and are worth the cost.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these for my daughters birthday. I gave them to her yesterday. I ordered them on Amazon Prime day so the window for returning was August 18th. I assumed ( hoped) they would work directly out of the box. My daughter was so excited to get these and they don't work! One side of the headphones is silent. I am SO DISAPPOINTED and am wondering if perhaps they sent out faulty ones on Amazon Prime Day? I did not buy the warranty because I assumed these were high quality headphones that would work if taken care of. I guess I learned my lesson about buying something and holding onto it for a gift at a later date. :-(,1.0 out of 5 stars
I have 2 pair of these and both stopped working via bluetooth after about a year. If you google beats stop working in 1 ear you will see all kinds of reviews.

"I had this unit for more than a month before returning it. Right off the bat, I didn’t like the controls being on the left side. Most people are right handed. Why put the controls on the left? Not only that but the functional layout of the controls were a little confusing. The power button (located on the right, go figure) was so tiny. I couldn’t locate the stupid thing after I had already put the headphones on. I felt like I was reading braille. I could not adjust it comfortably on my head, especially in the gym, in a good position w/o it falling every so often. I’d like to think I have a normal size head. On the plus side, the range (at least 60 ft.) and battery life (with 2/3 hrs of use per day could last a week w/o charging) was excellent. Oh, I liked the red/black combination of colors.",3.0 out of 5 stars

After paying $230+ for these earphones, I was severely disappointed on the quality. If you do decide sink this much money into these, make sure to get a warranty.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Received these today. Genuine, brand new product in factory packaging. I had the solo2 for a long time and have been pretty rough on them, gym sweat finally killed them.

"These headphones, like other beats products, have great quality not just in sound, but the design and everything that comes with it. The headphones are amazing to tune out from your surroundings and just jam out to whatever you like and not worry about missing a call or taking out your phone to adjust the volume or pausing your music or video. Everything is there on the left side phone to make your life easier. My only problem with these headphones is the On the ear design, Your better off getting Studio 3's if you're looking for comfortability while wearing these. Over long periods of time they start to hurt your ear and for instance, let's say you are laying in bed, u can't necessarily wear them while laying on your side, the only position u can wear them in bed is to face up. either way, these headphones are good, the only downside is to how long you can endure their uncomfortability that's all.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"overall, if i could go back and not buy this, i would. this is more of a brand type head set, i don't believe it's worth what you're getting. i've been told you can get some for 150 that sound better than this, and i'm looking into it myself. i feel cool walking around with this expensive head set, and i suppose it's not horrible, but as for someone who is not blessed with money, i would say don't waste your money if you're expecting $250 quality, i would say these are worth about 150 instead. battery life is amazing, a 5 minute charge can last me hours, and i can listen an entire week for several hours on a full charge with out needing to charge again. i give these a 3 because there is good qualities, but the price is just a deal breaker for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I’ve been rocking old school wired Bose QC’s for years (and never write product reviews). As a frequent traveler I rely heavily on my Bose Noise Cancelling “capabilities” - not something these Beats really have. That said, I paid $130 for this lil set-up on Prime Day - fantastic deal. A “whole” day into wearing them and I’ve got to say it just may have been the best $130 I’ve ever spent (heck, they could fall apart tomorrow for all I know). First, I’m really kicking myself in the butt for not going wireless sooner - I’m always snagging the wires on something and popping the wire plum out). Wireless is so liberating!!! The range on these things is incredible. I’ve got a pretty big house and I haven't found a reasonable area where the signal poops out (w/o curling up in a closet upstairs w/ my ipad in the garage). Second, the sound - crisp, clear and plenty loud. I’ve not taken them off since getting them - No doubt that’s going to agitate my wife:). Admittedly I’ve always been a Bose fanboy (not an audiophile though) and dismissed Beats all together as “just another shiny object w/ a great marketing angle”. My kids of course only wear Beats and tell me how much of an old man I look like with my wired Bose phones. Finally, battery life “if as advertised”. I’ve got about 12 hours on these guys so far which already impresses me:). The only “Cons” (it applies to most on-ear phones) are Noise in - they're not Noise Cancelling nor are they advertised to be / and Noise out - I’ve been listening to these things a fair bit louder than I do with my other headphones - when I take them off I notice how loud they are potentially to those around me (going to need to keep the volume at a reasonable setting I suppose). These things rock though - I keep finding myself dancing around the house and I’m no dancer. Get a pair, you wont regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

First were mixrs from Best Buy so I know they’re the same beats value. BUT After multiple cables I contacted Apple. Was thankfully still under warranty. Currently shipping for repair. Hoping it’s covered. I was skeptical about buying something like this on amazon.

Half the time, I don't even put on music, I just ""activate"" the super power of noise cancelling and it's like magic. I do use them while at work and even after I've had them on for hours, they're still comfortable.

I tried all the different methods on their site and what others suggested doing, but nothing worked. I contacted beats support and they said I was out of the limited service warranty period so I would need to pay $129 to have them fixed or replaced.

I bought my first pair at $200+ and the second pair at $150 and now they want another $129 to fix a problem that seems to be an ongoing issue with their product due to poor construction. Aside from that, they sound good, which is why I feel inclined to give 2 stars, but based on my experience with these headphones that’s as much as I’m willing to rate it due to poor construction and warranty services.

Started return process and agent said he notified some dept & Beats regarding the problem, so...hopefully...this pair of headphones doesnt get sold to yet another customer. BE CAREFUL WITH USED ITEMS EVEN SOLD BY AMAZON! Headphones failed to pair to an Android phone. Phone didnt recognize them. They might work after charging, but I didnt risk it due to the cost.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Had a pair of Beats a few years ago and loved them. Bought these on Prime day for half off and as usual are my favority headphones once again. Very long battery and overall great sound. I also have Bose headphones and these are far superior in sound and quality in my opinion. I also like low end in music being a drummer.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Earpieces are falling apart. This was an absolutely joke of a product to buy. They're not being worn for working out or any activity that would warrant the earpieces to fall off of the headphone. Prior to this, the leather around the earphone was coming off, like many other reviews stated. BE AWARE, this is either an absolutely fake product, or beats are some crappy headphones. More than likely the former. DO NOT BUY! Please! Save yourself the headache.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"These were what one of my grandsons wanted for his birthday. I had no idea if they really were worth the money, but he was ecstatic when he opened them, as were the other grandsons. I listened through them and it was a great quality of music and sound cancellation. I've no idea of the battery life as I've not asked him. He still loves his headphones and Nana and Papa gained big points in gift giving with these. Hah.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Got these for Mothers day last year. Started wearing them in January on a daily basis. They only lasted 4 months and then they would no longer turn on. Said theynm had a full charge but would never turn on again. Waited a few days and kept trying them. Called Apple to have them repaired and got nothing but horrible customer service. Apple just lost another fan. If they can't stand behind their products or at least build something that works longer than 4 months, they are no better than their Chinese Knock-offs. My husband bought a similar wireless pair on Amazon for $29 and they sound the same but have lasted him the entire time he has owned them with no issue. He just ordered me a pair. Could have bought 8 pair for the price of these crappy beats.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Not a knockoff.
These are the best sounding pair of headphones I’ve ever owned, and the decision to purchase was not taken lightly because of the cost. Sound quality is amazing. I’m hearing lyrics I’ve never heard before.

The ONLY downside to these is comfort. They’re fine if I’m wearing them for only an hour at a time, but any longer than that and my ears start to hurt because of the pressure. It almost makes me want to consider saving up for a pair of over-the-ear Studios.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I take care of all the electronics I own. I've gone through maybe ten or fifteen pairs of earbuds so far. These beats aren't those earbuds, and they aren't like many headsets

This is a stupidly comfortable over ear headset with the sound and design to match its Apple product cost. It has lasted me seven months without any sign of trouble. It is sturdy, easily collapsible, and a fast charge for the one or two week charge you could get out of it, even with playing music everyday. Its bluetooth connection is crystal clear and easy to configure most of the time.

However, I am a six foot adult male with a big head. I should've gone with the Beats Studio 3 since its a much larger design for a little bit more money. I don't even remember how I broke the bands on the sided of the headset, though I'm keeping them together via tape. The cost to repair the headset IN APPLE STORE STYLE costs as much as the headset, which is ridiculous. Thankfully, my beats are still fully functioning, and I plan on buying another headset when I have the money.",4.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are great if you can get them to connect to your iPhone. It takes about 15-30 minutes every time you want to get them to connect to your Bluetooth. I’ve tried everything. My headphones power button will be flashing and my iPhone will be searching and nothing happens. You just have to keep powering off the headphones and turn them back on to flashing or keep shutting your phone off and turning it back on. The 15th time of doing a combination of those things will eventually work and it will connect.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"I like these headphones because they look nice and the sound is pretty good. Unfortunately, after about an hour of wearing them, they start to hurt my ears and the sides of my head. Also the cable works for audio but the mic didn't work. I thought ""no biggie"" and ordered another cord but it was the same issue. Unlikely to buy again.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"These are the worst overpriced headphones ever!! They will not sync with my devices, which is my main complaint. The device name is a bunch of lower case “j”. I think these were factory reconditioned. I rarely write reviews but, this is the third product I’ve purchased recently from AMAZON and had nothing but problems with!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Love the product however it had to be replaced because it would not charge correctly. Luckily the year warranty covered it. This is the second pair I have had. The first pair has one headphone that no longer works and it wasn’t under warranty so I am stuck paying $150.00 to get it fixed. Therefore I bought a extended warranty for the the current pair. After paying over $300 for each pair I think they should last longer without having functional issues!,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I work with a lot of virtual conference calls. I had a Jabra provided through work, but couldn't pass up the prime day deal. The wireless microphone in the headset is fantastic. Very important to mute as it will pick up quite a bit.

Connects with ease to all my devices--iphone, bluetooth dongle on desktop pc, work lenovo laptop.

I seem to only have to charge once per week. I was torn between this set and a bose set. I don't regret my choice.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I wish i wouldve just bought these at the store brand new instead of on here. Headphones are not new!!! Ive had them barely over a month and they wont stay charged for the bluetooth and now the sound is going out. I've only worn these probably a handful of times.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I got these headphones to replace a Phillips brand that more than exceeded my expectations for the price I paid. I chose Beats brand because of their quality reputation and was really excited for their noise cancellation ability. While the unboxing was impressive and I enjoyed a full charge at arrival, these offer absolutely no noise cancellation as advertised. I bought two pair: one for myself and one for my kiddo. For the price I paid, I am extremely disappointed.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased these to finally go wireless with less ports on my work machine than before and I got to use these for about 6 months before they stopped charging completely, rendering them useless as wireless headphones.

They’re very pretty, and the folding aspect with the case is clever. The wire for using them as wired is nice but, if I wanted wired headphones I wouldn’t have paid an extra $100 for these.

Additionally, it’s worth noting that you should be aware of the size of your head. I wear glasses and found these very uncomfortable to wear after an hour or two because they pushed the arms of the glasses into the sides of my head. I could get around it by pushing the arms of my glasses over the ear cushion but this obviously messed with my astigmatism prescription.

The charging problem is not a one-off thing. Do a web search and see that many people have needed to fix this and it involves cutting open the headphone to rewrite it yourself.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these because they were on sale for $140 that day. That’s a decent price for them. I wouldn’t pay much more though. They are a little tight and pinch my ears after awhile—my head is not huge.

NOTE: the studio version has noise cancellation, the solo version does not. I bought these bc they were cheaper and the noise cancellation function gives me motion sickness.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"My fiancé gifted these to me for Christmas to replace my old Beats which were not wireless.

I love these so much! The color is beautiful and actually matches my hair. Sometimes my family tries talking to me not realizing I can’t hear.

The battery has up to 40 hours and it really does feel like it lasts forever. I can’t wait till I travel again because they are going to be amazing to use.

I highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones were terrible! When the box arrived, it was not completely sealed. It looked as if it had been previously opened. Also, the zipper to the carrying case that comes with it was broken.

After using it only 4 times, and within the first week of owning them, the material broke away from the plastic on the right side air phones as shown in the picture. Also, the headphones plastic cracked and split open and the backing to the auxiliary device mic fell off and wouldn’t click back on. I question the authenticity of this product. I feel like I purchased a knock off sent to me in an original box. Not happy. Returning them.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I will admit I am a long-time review lurker, but never actually post reviews here because I'm lazy. However, I felt as if I should give an honest review for these, as the holiday season is approaching.

I'm a HUGE music guy and have had a pair of Beats and every On-Ear model since they first rolled out. My Solo 2 wired in headphones got stolen out of my luggage and I recently got the iPhone 8, so I figured it was finally time to venture into the ""Wireless"" territory. I purchased the Solo 3 Wireless Gloss Black pair back at the end of September and everything came as expected and they looked awesome.

However, after 45 min at the gym and them being fully charged, they just turned off and would not power back on. I tried numerous Youtube videos of resetting them and charging them, but nothing. I chatted with an Apple associate and ended up bringing them in to the Genius Bar and even they were baffled at what was going on. I sent them in for repair and got them back a few days later and after one use the same issue occurred.

I then went to the Apple store again and we looked at everything, software on my phone, the headphones, etc, and they were still baffled. I sent them in again and they sent me a new pair. This new pair worked well, but would not power off (light always flashing) and also would not charge at all. Maybe it was just the Gloss Black style? I don't know.

Finally, after about a month of frustration, I sent them back to Amazon and searched forever on Amazon for a new pair of great wireless headphones (since I used gift cards to buy this), but could not find anything that had the fashion, fit and sound that I liked from my Beats.

As a loyal Beats fan, I insanely purchased a new pair of the regular Black Solo 3 Wirless beats and so far everything has been working amazingly, the sound is awesome, the battery life is insane and they fit perfectly for when I'm going running.

Moral of the story is these headphones are really great, but like they always say, ""third time was a charm"" and the whole process of getting there was a bit frustrating. Therefore, I caution on the side of buying any warranty on these, as all of my costs were taken care of and I didn't spend a penny extra.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm a headphone enthusiast and I love these headphones. I have Sennheiser 600HD's, amped, in ear monitors, in ear Bose headphones, and about 4 other cans.

I would say these are ""Fun"". They don't have a huge sound stage, but you can't expect a huge soundstage from on ear headphones. They sound great for Bluetooth headphones and they feel comfortable.

I originally bought these for use in the gym since I workout 6-7 days a week but honestly I sweat way too much and these only make it worse. If you're a sweater then don't get these on ear headphones, you'll be miserable, you'd probably be better off with the in ear power beats.

I give these 5 stars though because they just sound fantastic. And they have a 40 hour battery life. That's just wild to me. They are the best (or should I say the funnest?) Bluetooth headphones I've tried out so far and I tried out quite a few before buying these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Ok so I’m a really picky person when it comes to headphones, I have gone through jbl, skullcandy, Apple. You get the point, I’ve been through a ton of headphones, but these ones have satisfied me the most. Alright to my review, bass: bass is alright I’d say, enough to satisfy me, not to much not to less, I will be honest when this is at max volume, it will shake your head hard, but if you can’t handle that volume I do not recommend. Sound quality: this is what I love about them the most, their sound quality is litteraly crystal clear. absolutely recommended if you just want to hear every detail of the music and video that you are watching. Comfort: the insides are made of memory foam which is really soft when worn in warm temperatures, which is really good, the top part has padding. but when in a cold temperature it gets really hard and uncomfortable, so if your looking for headphones for a cold climate, I do not recommend these, I have a couple of friends who absolutely destroyed their headphones, like torn the leather from the headphones, but to prevent that, keep it in a case at all times you are not using it, don’t leave it on the floor, on a desk, basically anywhere without its case(provided). Noise cancellation: their is some to no noise cancellation on these headphones, so if your in a loud environment your going to hear it. Noise leakage: I have tested these in a quiet environment and no one will here you, ok if it is at like max they can here it but it’s like a whisper(friend told me). So if your looking to listen to this in like a library, these absolutely for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones were a splurge for me but turned out to be an expensive disappointment. Wireless solo3 right side stopped working after warranty expired. Took great care in keeping these headphones pristine and even bought an additional matching case. Fees to repair start at $130 with $7 shipping just to look at them. Waste of money and won’t be replacing them with Beats. I can buy better ones from other companies for less than the cost to repair or replace.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I reeeeeally wanted to like this. I have another brand already and heard my sister's Beat. I decided to get myself one. The sound quality does not justify the price. It is not far from the $37.00 wireless unit I have, but fine I was going to keep it anyways. Then the biggest obstacle was the functionality. On my headphones, I can easily maneuver back, forth and sound up and down. The Beats did not seem to have the feature. Nothing other than power on and off. I am rather computer savvy but could not make it work. Back to the MPOW unit. It functions better for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First off the connectivity of these is great. I was two floors above my phone and they performed like normal! I am an Apple user so that might be why it's so good. These are super comfortable and they fit my head super well! The battery life is no joke too, I charged them too 93 percent used them the entire day checked the battery and there was still 87 percent left! Once you put these on at about 5 or 6 volume everything else fades out. The controls on these are also super helpful. You can adjust the volume, activate Siri, pause songs (works with Spotify) and pick up and hang up calls, I mean what else could you want. These look super sleek on your head. I recommend the matte black because then they don't take fingerprints and scratches easily. One other thing is the mic. It might just be me but there is a slight echo so you can hear what you are saying. Everyone that I've called says that I sound great! In conclusion, these are a great pair of headphones and they are totally worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These stopped working on one side; the leather started coming off! We

My wife uses these every time she goes to the gym - this is the first pair of expensive headphones that she is actually willing to use. Great battery life and works flawlessly with her iPhone. She is very pleased with the sound quality and it does a great job playing that hideous hip hop crap she listens to. Other reviews are luke-warm on this model but I can't agree with them - it's great value for money.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"it s the first time purchase an on-ear headphones so can not compare with other products. I have it for around 2 months now, sound quality is a bit above average, It has plenty of bass. like other Beats products, quality looks good. The battery life amazed me, 1 hour charge and I use it for 4-5 days, 10hrs/day. The range is pretty far, more than 50 yards I still have good connection. The only thing bothers me is that it hurts my ears after around 1 hour of using. I tried to stretch it by put it over a few book, then use hair dryer to heat it up, leave it over night. It helps quite a lot.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these for my hubby as a graduation present since the ones he had were the wired ones. Gave it to him for graduation and he originally didn't even use them for about a month. So, about 2 months after purchasing them the cover on the ear portion began to come apart. The thread just started to unthread and now you can see the cushion part of the ear. He doesn't even use them anymore. I am very disappointed as these headphones are not cheap and this was his graduation present for getting his Masters!",1.0 out of 5 stars
I got these for a trip and I still love them. They work very well and match my phone. They have a case so I can keep the cord and charger all together. They are adjustable and easy to set up. Noise quality is really great. These are not noise canceling ones but they block out noise well. They turn off in MN cold if you do Bluetooth but work just fine with the cord. There are many color options too.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The biggest quality these headphones have is by far how convenient they are and how easily they connect to an iPhone. They also look very good and the sound quality on these headphones is all right as long as you aren't expecting too much. The controls are also subtle and easy to reach.
However, I cannot recommend this product. The biggest problem with them is how fragile they are. After only six months of casual use, substantial damage is visible. Particularly on the headband, which lacks cushioning and tears very quickly. The other problem is the price. You can find headphones that accomplish the same job for about half the price when looking at brands like Sennheiser or AudioTechnica.
This product seems to be aimed at younger people looking for good looking and convenient headphones. I recommend that you save your money and look elsewhere for headphones that look just as good, sound just as good and are far cheaper.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Birthday present for my 15 year old, he absolutely loves them. I tried them myself and the sound quality is amazing. Couple of quick points:
1. do not have the audio cable plugged in when trying to turn on or setup Bluetooth. The cable needs to be left out in order to do that.
2. if you do use the audio cable, the 90 degree elbow end goes into the audio device and the straight end goes into the headphones. otherwise you will only get sound out of one side.
We had a couple issues initially, but that is only because we didn't follow the above two points. After figuring those out, the headphones work great. Great sound and decent comfort. Easy to setup.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I am constantly wearing headphones and wanted to switch it up by getting a pair of over the ear wireless headphones. I've been looking into getting Beats for a while and was excited to try these out!

1. I love the look of them! Thought I'd look hideous in over the ear wireless headphones but they're super cute and look great.

2. I love the optional cord to plug into devices (not the charger). Provides a nice option if you want to use that!

3. They're kind of comfy. Not the most comfortable I've ever experienced but decent. Maybe it adds to a little discomfort with the fact that I have multiple ear piercings that perhaps are a little smushed with these style of headphones.

4. The sound quality is AWESOME! So great.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"First off let me say that when they are not broken, they are excellent headphones. Sound quality, battery life, range, all of that is great. The problem is they are not durable at all. The first pair I owned, I had to send back to the manufacturer after 6 months due to the battery that all of a sudden stopped charging. It was under warranty so they were replaced. 9 months later the right headphone stopped working but because it was past their 1 year limited warranty (from purchase date) there wasn't anything I could do. I ended up giving them a second chance and buying a second pair, which lasted a little over a year until one side of the headphones (they are expandable) came clean off the headset. For $250 dollars I expect them to last longer than a year. I would suggest going with a different companies product unless you are comfortable replacing these every 12-18 months. All in all its been 28 months since I bought my first pair and now I need to buy a third set of headphones, it will not be from Beats.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Broke after a year. Nothing weird, just wouldn’t turn on one day. Sent them into apple for 130$ for service. After hours of dealing with the service department, they told me I “made product modifications” and they won’t fix them for the 130. These have never left the office. Essentially was accused of being some sort of bedroom hacker with my headphones? Stunningly ridiculous. They told me they’d fix them for $369. Not sure if they’re aware how much they are new? The whole experience is insulting, I won’t be buying more beats products.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Now she started back and has got a permanent pain in the lobes that hurts her in her day to day activities specifically sleeping as the ears touch he pillow. She has stopped using it now and this product is a waste for me. I want to return it back and need my refund but amazon will not entertain it now. It has created medical issues for my wife and the product is still almost new here. I invested money here and i m really really disappointed with the quality.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"Shockingly poor quality materials and subpar construction for a premium priced product from Beats (and Apple). The sound is solid - although they should get louder in my opinion - but after just a handful of months of ""light use"" they are literally falling apart.

The first Beats Solo3 received did not work. They would not go wireless nor would they fully work while plugged in. They had many issues. Amazon immediately sent a replacement as I packaged and sent the return item. The replacement head phones were as expected and worked great!

"I like this product very much. I have to say when I saw the packaging it made me realize how high the standards were. The unboxing experience was top notch and couldn’t ask for better. The first thing I notice when I put these headphones on was that the earmuffs were really soft and comfortable. Then I paired these up to my iPhone and I couldn’t even imagine the simplicity apple has created to pair these beats to a device. Next I played some music. It was very high quality and they were better than any of the headphones I’ve had before, the highs and lows were very balanced. And do not worry about these being counterfeit because I was worried when I purchased them but when I paired the beats there was proof of the W1 chip because of the simple pairing. The battery life on this is also remarkable I didn’t have to charge these for weeks till they were dead. Overall I really recommend picking these up, bye and I hope u like your beats. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these Beats headphones because they were on sale, and because I thought ""It's been a while since I had beats, maybe I should give them a second chance."" I should not have. I may be biased since I own high quality headphones, I have Bose QuietComfort 35ii and Sony WH-1000XM3s. I was expecting sound quality maybe just slightly below these with no active noise canceling since they were just on-ear and what I got was far below my expectations.

Sound Quality: 2/5
By no means are these the worse headphones I've ever listened to, but they are the worst headphones I have ever listened to at this price point. The trebles are just meh and that's the best part of these headphones. The mids sound like you're listening to someone else's party down the street or you're listening to someone else's music through a wall. It's atrociously bad and this is the worst part of the headphone. The bass is actually okay... until you have both bass and another range of sound playing at the same time. The bass quality is nice, and these really boost bass but you sacrifice washing out the rest of the song into a muddle mess and hearing nothing but slapping bass. This is fine, if you're a basshead and these headphones are GREAT when I'm listening to a bass-heavy rap song or EDM, but when I want to listen to anything else they're pretty trash.

Appearance: 3/5
These are beats and they look more like a fashion statement than any real headphones. Audiophiles will smirk as you pass by them because they know you paid way more than these are actually worth.

Comfort: 1/5
The clamping force is too hard for anyone to wear comfortably especially compared to what else is on the market for this price point. On top of that the materials used are super uncomfortable. The rubber headband pulls on your hair (and mine's short, I'm in the Marine Corps), the ear cups are stiff and made of some type of pleather probably, and after a half hour of wearing them (ONLY A HALF HOUR!!) I don't want to continue listening to these headphones since they push on my ears uncomfortably, grip my head and pull my hair (I'm not that into BDSM, thank you).

Ease of Access (iOS): 3/5
Ease of Access (everything else): 1/5

Connecting to an iPhone or iPad is a breeze, just turn the headphones on and bam you're connected for the most part. Sometimes it's a little finnicky. In comparison, the airpods have a much smaller form factor, better latency and better range.

Connecting to any other device is like trying to fight your mom; you'll probably win, but is it worth it? Definitely not. These will connect to your other devices, but in order to stop it from connecting to my iPad even when I had told my iPad to forget these headphones I had to take my iPad to another room and turn on these headphones outside with the device I wanted. Definitely cumbersome.

For full price of $299.99 these are just not worth it. Even for the discounted price of $160, they just aren't worth it.
Amazon has plenty of other well-priced headphones on the market...

For bassheads: Skullcandy Crusher Wireless ($120)
For flat EQ but good sound: Bose QuietComfort 35ii ($350)
For the best acoustic sound: Sony WH-1000XM3 ($350)
Best sound on a budget: Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (on sale for $130, but usually $150)

In summary, if you want convenient iOS headphones, just buy the airpods. If this is you're first time venturing into the expensive headphone market, I hope this review helped you move away from these headphones. I really don't know who these are for except people who were previously fans of the Beats line. If anything though, I think their sound quality has further degraded from when Beats was partnered with monster headphones. I hope this review helped!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are AWESOME! As a Mom, I am typically not a “name brand” kind of person. These were a gift from my husband and really a splurge, but I absolutely love them. Doing laundry, dishes, and other housework is much more enjoyable listening to music and these do not fall off my head like other headphones and earbuds I have owned in the past. So any Moms out there who aren’t sure about these, just go ahead and make the purchase. High quality, easy to connect, and well worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars

2- Ears get too hot at gym because of the leather. I would really prefer if they made another sport line that contains cushion instead.

Concentrate on the performance & comfort. The only difference between Solo 2 & 3 is battery which doesn’t make sense",3.0 out of 5 stars
If you are a bass hunter or like dubstep this is for you otherwise look for better quality headphones low range is non existent or muffled and medium is there but super heavy on bass and the wireless works well but not long range enough the earpads are the same from other models so they will ware out better to buy replacements now or higher quality ones. You are buying the name not good headphones. Decent battery life.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"My nephews wanted these, and they love them. They sound okay to me, but I'd honestly look elsewhere if you want a high-quality, comfortable pair of headphones.

The bluetooth and battery life are the real pluses on these. The battery lasts forever, they charge pretty quickly, and the bluetooth has a really good range. The sound tends to be a bit bass-heavy and possibly muddy, and I don't know how comfortable they would be over a long session. I tried them out only for a few minutes and could only go off of my immediate impressions.

Depending on your genre preferences, these may be suitable. For me, I would look elsewhere.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I went through every process detailed to check whether they were real or not after I got them on a too-good-to-be-true Prime Day deal. From everything I can tell they are, and they register with the Beats Software Updater.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones sound really good like other beats headphones I have had. The problem with these headphones is how uncomfortable they are. If you are only using them for 30 minutes or so they are just fine. Anything more than that your ears will start hurting more and more. I don't know why they went with on ear headphones pads instead of over ear headphones. The studio headphones I have are over ear and they can be worn for hours without any discomfort.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I really enjoy the convenience of these wireless headphones. They're easy to use and fit comfortably over my ears. They're not too heavy, which I was concerned about because I plan to run in them, and the collapsible arms are helpful for storage. In terms of sound quality, I don't feel that they're especially better than other good quality headphones, but they're good. The sound quality certainly isn't compromised at all. Whether intentional or not, they do have some noise cancellation effect also which I appreciate. Overall, pleased with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"The problem with this product is not the quality but the user unfriendliness of it’s design.
You don’t even know if it’s off or on, because there is no signal... either the design is flawed or the product I received is defective.
Having some kind light that indicates it’s on will help... per the user manual it says the fuel gauge will light white... the product I got only shows the lights when it’s only plugged to usb...",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I just ordered and received these headphones today (same day delivery with Prime). I'll start by saying they are authentic Beats (Fulfilled by Amazon). I purchased the protection plan just in case. That being said, i'm listening to music with these headphones as I write this review, and they are perfect.

They'll be gym tested tomorrow, but based on the fit, I don't anticipate any issues. A great first impression.

Build: 4 - Lightweight and sturdy construction
Comfort: 5 - Snug fit...stays on my head, and they fit comfortably
Sound 5 - The sound is great. I'm no audio expert, but it offers deep, rich sounds",5.0 out of 5 stars
My granddaughter loved them. She plays the piano and can hook them up to her keyboard and listen to songs as she plays them back on the piano without bothering the rest of her family. The sound seems to be awesome and it was just the pick of Christmas. I bought a blue pair for her brother and he loves his as well. His were the Solo2 and there is not a lot of difference between the Solo2 or the Solo3...,5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are awesome. I love everything about them, but mostly the Mickey design; however, I also happened to get my son a pair of Bose, and I would definitely rethink my purchase no matter how much I love Mickey Mouse.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bingo! As an older fella I haven’t been impressed with all the young studs walking around with these but, in desperation, I ordered a pair and have never looked back. I like them. They sound terrific and young beautiful women are walking past me without noticing a darned thing. Battery life? I’ve had them for a month now and STILL haven’t used the charging cable.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is amazing and I love it, but only use it for less than 2 months and the sound is not playing in the right ear. I expected a higher quality especially since this is not a cheap headset. I expected more from beats, my husband have the pro and my son the solo. This solo3 is the only one not working. I'm very disappointed and sad since I really enjoyed it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I order the headphones thinking they would do me justice on my deployment in Kuwait but I was wrong like way wrong. The first month they were perfect in every aspect of the word but out of nowhere one side went out and would barely work since. Two more months passed and then they just stopped working all together and since the warranty was with a 3rd party it just left me with broken headphones in the middle of my deployment. I will never buy anything like this from amazon again and amazon was my trusted source till now. So be careful what you buy and trust and believe these are trash.,1.0 out of 5 stars
90 days after purchasing the material began to tear away from the head piece. I took it to the Apple store and they replaced them only to have it happen within 90 days again. Warranty is now up and I refuse to order another pair or pay for them to be fixed. The quality does NOT justify the price and I’ll NEVER order another pair.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Power button stopped working after a little over a year, which after some extensive googling seems to be a very common problem with beats headphones. They were decent quality in terms of audio, not completely sound cancelling, but I liked them. If I’m honest I bought them mainly for their battery life and their appearance. Sad to have lost them, which I guess indicates something in their favor. But angry enough not to want to buy them again.",2.0 out of 5 stars
After only 6 months there is a short and they won’t work. This is our second pair of beats. The first pair quit working just over a year old.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"They sound really good. I haven't tested a bunch of brands, but I know Beats get really good reviews. The only reason I don't give them five stars is this: After about 8 months of use, these wireless headphones are starting to do what my wired Beats did -- the foam is starting to peel away on the ears. It's not the end of the world....I'll probably order some replacements when they come all the way off. But this issue keeps them from being a five-star product.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"It’s a bit base heavy, as it is designed to do, but I feel my music sounds so much better with it streaming from my iPhone.
I prefer it to the Grados my husband owns....
Headphones sit securely on my head even when running on the elliptical and working out. Very comfortable without feeling too snug. No headaches from wearing them for hours on end. Yeahy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Was looking to upgrade from my original solo’s and I’m incredibly pleased with the Solo3’s. These headphones are so aesthetically pleasing! I got the Satin Silver color and I am so happy with how crisp they look. These are more comfortable than the original Solos and seem to be constructed in a more solid manner (I threw in a picture of my old white Solos for comparison, which might I add lasted me SEVEN years without trouble, hoping for the same longevity with the Solo3’s). The Solo3’s sound awesome and the pairing capabilities are lightining fast due to the w1 chip that allows for speedy pairing with Apple devices. I will update once I’ve had these headphones for longer to report on their durability and battery life. Extremely happy with my purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Item was listed as “NEW”. I received it and it wasn’t sealed, had greasy finger prints all over the headset, there was a beat up LG charger to replace the original one, the case was missing, and the instructions were missing as well. Make not want to ever order a used item even though I didn’t order one this time",1.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are really nice. The bass isn't too crazy but enough where it doesn't disort it. The sound overall is pretty decent. They connect easy and have impressive battery life. They last about 2 days without disconnecting them once. I would recommend these but make sure you read the specs before you buy if your looking for super loud bass headphones,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I love this headphones, they connect so easy to any device, ipad, TV, phone, and the sound is just amazing. I wanted this headphones because I've been doing binural meditation and I wanted to cancel any noise. I don't like having anything inside my ear and the tiny succion headphones create some king of pressure on my ears, instead of meditating I keep focusing on how my ears feel. I got my headphones on sale and although I wanted another color (whcih was not on sale) they are woth the price!! Best of all is that I can watch tv late without bodering anybody.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Much, much too expensive for what you get. My 11 yr old son insisted on these because of the brand name. The sound quality and build quality aren't nearly as good as what you get for this price from Bose, Sennheiser or Grado. The plastic circle behind the driver pops off every week or two because the plastic tabs holding it together don't fit tight enough. Bluetooth connection is pretty solid to both Apple and Android devices.",2.0 out of 5 stars
I love the headphones in general but have found that after 30 minutes of use and they make my ears hurt. They push against my piercings into my cartilage to be quite sore. I have attempted to get replacement ear cushions in hopes of getting some a little bigger but if you change ear cushions then it voids warranty. They also do not offer replacement ear cushions from beats. So in my case they have not been worth the money I spent on them. I attempted to allow my 11 year old to use them and he states it hurts his ears also. Might be just us might be a issue for others as well. I would go with the studio headphones if you getting them over the ear.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchase Beats Solo 3 brand new sealed but after when i received i noticed item it was open box and no sealed possible from manufacturer when i open i saw the quality of the item is so cheap look like fake or someone use before and return to amazon i go to apple store and purchase this from them and compered together it was lot different , amazon buyer be ware make sure receive the item brand new and sealed not open box",2.0 out of 5 stars
I have had these headphones for almost 2 weeks now and I love them! They are able to connect to all of my devices via bluetooth with no issues and they hold a charge for a long time. I use them for hours on end and haven't had a problem with the battery getting low or dying on me. The sound is also great. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a bit tight on my ears and it starts to hurt after about an hours use. I ordered the gloss black which I feared may look cheap or leave fingerprint marks but it actually looks very nice in person and doesn't get dirty easily.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are awesome for working out in a crowded gym– noise cancelling enough to block out all the other machines without having to turn up my music to dangerously high volumes, big enough to signal “don’t talk to me”, and adjustable so they don’t fall off my head when I’m doing abs or something (a big problem for me, I have a tiny and weird shaped head). Plus, the matte black is very pretty (in my opinion). Plus, the automatic connection from the W1 chip to my iPhone is a MAJOR bonus over the older models; otherwise, I can’t tell much of a difference from my old Solo2s. If you don’t have an iPhone, maybe save your money and go for an older model, but if you do, then the W1 is an amazing investment. Overall, I love em!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great sound, comfortable headphones and great price! All wireless! Great color and was waiting to get these when I could afford it, but these are $110 less than I have seen elsewhere so became my birthday present to myself! Convenient with a carry case. I would have made the zipper on the carry case open wider, but that is my only complaint. Even has a carabiner to snap it on something for safe traveling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought as a gift and my husband LOVES them! He likes to listen to house music so the bass is a huge deal. He could not stop talking about how incredible they are. While not deafeningly loud to the wearer, people around can hear the music. So I wouldn't recommend wearing them at a high volume in a library or someplace where you need to be quiet. The sound quality is superb though.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Very very VERY disappointed! After less than 6 months of using them (and I bought two pairs!) both are:
- Having problems since day one to connect through Bluetooth
- Going away and coming back sound quality
- Need to be charged for over 24hrs to work for 2hrs straight
- Disconnecting in the middle of work online meetings and webinars
- Currently, both pairs are NOT WORKING!!!

I am utterly disappointed, upset and I would never EVER recommend this product! I have been THE BIGGEST FAN of Dr. Beats and the products over the years but this has been super disappointing, especially buying them for Christmas gifts and never dropping them or doing anything that would harm the product or sound....
I want the seller to contact me immediately!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Liked them, sound was good, but they crapped out. No power. No lights. Charge was good while it lasted. Bought a new battery, but it didn’t fix them.

Super expensive for headphones that only made it 2 years. And, I really babied them. I have other Bluetooth cans and speakers (JBL’s and Mpow’s) that are much less expensive that are still working great. Surprisingly great sound on the cheaper ones also.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"So, everything came great and it was good quality. I just got a headache from wearing them because it was too tight on my head and the pressure changed in my ears. If pressure and band size isn't an issue for you then this should work great but if you are prone to headaches the pressure of these headphones won't be for you.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm a huge Disney nut & wanted these soooo bad but didn't want to pay $300. So when they finally went on sale during Black Friday deals, I was super excited!! At first they great & then after about an hour, they became really uncomfortable on my ears. It felt as though they were clamping my ears down to my head like a vice grip. I tried adjusting them, taking out my earrings or just moving them around in general. The only thing that helped was taking them off. I was so disappointed and had no choice but to return them. They were no good to me if I couldn't wear them for more than an hour at a time.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Battery power is phenomenal.
Two weeks without charging. Everyday use. The only down fall is the case in which the headphones come. It is so small and won’t protect headphones but that can be easily replaced by buying a bigger/hard case which there’s a lot to choose from here at amazon. Worth the price for the quality and duration of battery!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is my second pair of Beats Headphones my first wireless version. They are perfect!! I fly all over the US almost every week. They connect to my ipad and phone effortlessly. The sound is rich and you can hear everything. Even thought they are not touted as ""noise cancelling headphones"" I find that they do a very good job at keeping the airplane noises to a minimum. I recommend these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Can’t say enough about the battery life. Bought them for my 12 year old who consistently is hooked up to wired headphones. He uses them for hours during the day and hasn’t had to charge them in 3 weeks. They still have 53% battery life left. Specifications say 70hr battery life but I really didn’t expect it. Only downfall is, the case provided with them is a soft case and not very protective so I would definitely consider spending an additional $10 on a hard case for them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Everything was great—worked just as described, looks good, excellent sound quality and very comfortable.....and then if got cold. Not crazy cold—it’s just 25F —just below freezing.

"Beats Solo3 Wireless do not disappoint at any aspect. Great sound, long battery life, easy to use, very comfortable, looks awesome. We are price sensitive buyers and we would like to get our money's worth. These headphones are a good value-for-money purchase. We gave this as a gift to our son and he loves it! It's really hard to get these out of his hands and I ""borrow"" them whenever I get a chance. I am looking at getting a pair for myself, too.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"My biggest complaint is that for an iOS device there’s no iOS App. You have to go into Widgets and add Battery in order to see the level. Another issue is it should either charge via lightning or USB c cable, not micro USB.

The battery life is awesome,",4.0 out of 5 stars

The color is amazing, bass and sound quality are perfect, and the Bluetooth connection (including how far you can walk away from your phone) work great for me.

Love these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These lasted less than 3 months! Do not buy these. The quality of the product is obviously lacking. The number of people that report them breaking says a lot.

I love these headphones. I wear them to the gym regularly and use them for work conference calls. What blows my mind is I've only had to charge them maybe 4x in the several months that I've had them! Amazing product. The only negative is that they become a little uncomfortable after about 40 min esp if you're wearing earrings. But most of them do.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Super easy to sync with my iPhone and iPad. Good quality sound for a wireless set. The range and battery life are amazing. I can leave my iPhone in my locker at the gym and roam the whole building during my workout without losing signal.

"The sound quality is amazing and the battery duration is very long lasting.

I loved mine while they lasted. Now only one side works when I connect it through bluetooth. The head pad that it has is going to come off really fast after you use them for a couple of months.

"Bought these for my Wife - she loved them so much I bought another pair (not pink!) for myself and I have to say that overall, when paired with iPhone, they are amazing. Extreme battery life. Fast charging and sync very nicely.

I did have to buy earphone covers to use them for running though as they have a moisture shutoff that triggers if you sweat a lot.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I travel a ton for work and rely on headphones that will reduce the white noise of the planes engines when attempting to watch movies/shows or listen to music. These headphones were great at achieving that and super great in instantly connecting with my apple products.

Would consider buying new model if build issues were resolved.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"bought for 13 year old son for his birthday. This was the best price I could find after looking around online and in local stores.

"Headphones worked fine until sliding function broke. We used tape to hold it in place. Sent the product in and they refused to honor the warranty because applying tape was an ""unauthorized modification"". The tech couldn't care less and I've heard this is commonplace for Apple. They have your money...and guess what...they will gladly send you a new pair at ""market value"" which is currently $40 more than I paid for them. They broke within 2 months of ownership. Guess my son will have no headphones for his virtual school he is forced to attend. Thanks Apple for your compassion and commitment to reliability!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was very hesitant on buying Beats because normally they're heavy on the bass and muffled on the treble. Not with the Solo3. These were extremely well rounded in the Bass/ Treble. Don't get me wrong, these headphones have a lotta Bass at a high volume and the treble is adjusted acoustically to sound normal and not muffled. At a low volume, the treble jumps out at you with a crystal clear sound and the bass is adjusted to a low roar.

The weight is pretty well distributed. They sit pretty well on your head with no extreme tightness on the ears or the head. Yes, they sit on the ears instead of over the ears. I didn't realize this until I received them. I have used some like this in the past and didn't care for the feel or the sound of them. Once I tried on the Solo3, I could tell this wasn't the same story like in the past. The leather padding is great. A pillow - like feel on the ears makes these comfortable to wear for hours. Adjusting them is very easy also. Just pull , right above the headphone, up or down to fit your ear height. Also the headphones fold inward for easy storage.

Battery usage is definitely a plus on these Beats! Their claims that it last about 40 hours is right on target. The first time I used them, the battery lasted about 38 hours but after I charged them it went as long as 42 hours on a single charge so go figure. The 10 minute fast charge does last a good 3 hours so that is definitely a plus in my book.

As for looks, you can't go wrong. Typical Beats good looks, just packaged in a smaller size. I went with the flat or matte black. I don't care for the ""fingerprint"" look so I didn't go with the glossy black because reviewers say it is a fingerprint magnet.

Connection is a breeze with Bluetooth and even better if you have the iPhone 7. If you don't have the iPhone 7 or iOS 10+ then Bluetooth connectivity is as usual: turn on the Bluetooth on your device and look for Solo3. For IPhone 7 or iOS 10+ just turn on the Bluetooth and connect it once and your iPhone will remember the Solo3. Now, the next time you turn on your Beats headphones it will automatically connect to your iPhone.

The Beats Solo3 package came with its own storage bag, USB A-to-USB micro-B for charging and a male to male 3.5mm cord to use the headphones without the use of the Bluetooth.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Not sure what the previous buyers received but I just got these Solo3 headphones December 2019 and they are phenominal! I was nervous ordering them after reading the previous reviews, but I’m SO glad I ignored them in this case.

"These aren’t advertised to be noise-canceling, so I’m not sure why I’m asked to rate that aspect.

"I use my beats every day to listen to music, podcasts, and audiobooks.

You do have to break them in though, they hurt really bad for the first few days after only an hour or two of wearing and I have a small head.

They also get stretched out and then become too loose, so I can't use them to work out or really do anything but sit or walk while wearing. I don't even trust wearing them while washing dishes because they'll slip forwards off my face.

I love my beats but I wish they were designed to fit better.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I got these things as a gift from my wife last Christmas. By June the black cover around the ear piece began to fall off. Called in and covered under warranty and replaced no problem. Fast forward 6 months doing same exact thing but warranty no longer applies after they are replaced once. Definitely won’t buy this brand ever again. Shortly after the foam wore off they completely quit working on the right side. Technically $200 for 6 months of use,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Solo3 will not disappoint! If you're looking for headphones with crippling bass these ain't it. However, the balance of sound from high, low and mid is amazing! The bass doesn't drown out the others, nor do the others cancel the bass effect. Just a well rounded pair of headphones. Love them!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I didn't read the reviews before purchasing these, but after hitting the purchase button I decided to go through some and see if there was a common issue. Well, I kept seeing that people were reporting getting fakes/refurbished products. So I became alarmed. They were same day delivery so when I got home and saw the box I was nervous I was sent fakes or refurbished headphones. Well after doing thorough research and watching several youtube videos, I discovered they were in fact real. I have had them for a week now and my only complaint is that they are a bit tight over my ears where my glasses are, but I suppose that's my bad for wearing glasses. Otherwise, they hold a charge forever, my last beats (purchased new at Best Buy) only lasted maybe 6-8 hours. These can go a few days which is nice. The sound quality is good, though they are not noise cancelling. I didn't need that since I mainly use these in my office at work, and I want to be able to hear if someone knocks at my door or walks in. Overall, pretty good!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought this for my son. Who said the sound is excellent. The ear muffs ""just"" covers the ears. but this is fine watching my son who plays D1 HS Basketball he'll take this off and leave around his neck. Because the ear muffs are small it doesn't get in the way under his chin. We tested the range some bit. No problem about 30ft. away. Sound and stream was still excellent. of course you'll always have the disance limitations set forth with Bluetooth tech specifications.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They were beautiful and great sound but hurt my ears.

"Pros: These headphones have great quality sound.
Cons: they smash my ears so after wearing them for any period of time my ears are sore. Overall they are not comfortable to wear. Additionally the case that they come in is ever so slightly bigger than the headphones so they have to be put in the case perfectly to fit.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are great quality headphones. I have owned a bunch of Beats headphones in the past but this is my first wireless pair. The bluetooth function works great and they can be converted to wired headphones just by plugging in the included wire. Sound clarity is amazing along with the bass. The only issue I have with these, as with all solo's, is that after having them on your head for an extended time they will hurt your ears/ make them sore. I would opt for he studios if you can.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I'm not going to delve into the subjective territory of sound quality. I will say that the sound is rich and performs better than expected (especially given Beats' history of emphasizing bass).

"I waited so long to buy the headphones. I tested them at an Apple Store and was amazed by the sound fidelity and bass. Even my wife was impressed. But I wasn’t in a good financial status, so I skipped the purchase at the time. That was last year. I heard about Amazon Prime days and decided to wait. The Solo 3 was the 1st thing that popped out when searching for electronic devices. And for $139 this time I would not let it pass away. Simply the best headphones that I have bought. And let me tell you I have bought many.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Good quality sound, looks nice, but cheap quality. However the first one I got malfunctioned with virtually no physical damage. I got a replacement. However the replacement broke a few months later again with no physical damage. I am disappointed. The headphones don't work wirelessly under 0 degrees centigrade (32 F) so if you live in an area that gets cold in the winter expect to bring the wire.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Let’s start with, I love Mickey. I definitely waited for the price to drop because (sorry, not sorry) Beats just isn’t worth it. The Mickey print is a beautiful matte. I really adore them but of course the sound quality/clarity just isn’t there.
If you want great headphones for a decent price, please go with Vmoda! My cross fade 100 beat $300 Beats headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I got these on Prime Day for a discounted price. I am not a headphone connoisseur but I was looking for something that was a little more suited for the office than my wireless in ear headphones I use at the gym. I have a loud intern that sits next to me who is the life of the office and needed something to block the noise out. It works. A little too well sometimes. I jump out of my skin at least 4 times per day when someone touches my shoulder or I see them out of the corner of my eye. Works for me.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've been a content user of corded, over-the-ear-headphones forever, always barely tolerating the cord getting hung up on my office chair several times a day... I've also been a bit of a snob about the Beats brand, shunning the brand hype and the expense. Not sure what put me over the edge, but I couldn't be happier that I made the leap/cut the cord. These headphones are fantastic. Battery life is excellent - I've had them for about 2 months and the battery still is half-charged. Great bluetooth range, superb sound. I use them daily at my desk job and at home (yard work, wood working projects, etc.). The controls on the headset are slick as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love these things because they cancel out loud, obnoxious noises (like your animals whining while you're trying to focus and study for a big test). They are also very comfortable to wear. I've had on-ear headphones in the past that were so tight they gave me a headache. I could wear these all day studying if I needed to!",5.0 out of 5 stars
I was surprised by the solo 3s good sounding. Use them as workout headphones. Not worth 300 but got them on sale and they are good sounding plenty of volume not to bass heavy but got good sound and bass to them. And still using them to work out with no problems. Of course they always go back into the case.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent fit powerful sound I actually gave these to my daughter she wanted some wireless headphones for when she works out at the gym these have met her expectations and more they are very comfortable she said I have tried them on and they are very comfortable with that and the sound is great if you’re looking for the beat sound with the wireless capability then I would recommend these,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I really like these headphones overall, the sound quality is good and they're decently noise-isolating. HOWEVER, I've had them only for about a year, and the battery life and their condition has declined significantly. While previously I only had to charge them once a month (with use for HOURS daily) now they barely last a few days. In addition, one of the side hinges is broken, and that side of the headphones doesn't stay collapsed, and will kind of swing out at random. In general, I like these, but please be warned that they probably won't last much more than a year and a half with normal use. Personally, I think they're far too expensive to have declined this quickly.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these in November of 2018. It’s June of 2020 and they are already broken. One ear isn’t working at all and the other if I press on it it will work otherwise it goes in and out and sounds like static. For the price, they should last a lot longer than what they did. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these head phones precisely for the noise cancellation feature. My spouse has to have the volume so high while watching tv I was in Hope's of being able to cancel out the sound and listen to another device while being able to say in same room as the tv. Did not cancel noise.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Wanted to buy the Wifey a BOSE noise cancelling headphone instead, but she wanted these. Regret not doing it, but I’m a die hard BOSE fan. These are a nice set of headphones though. They produce great sound, not noise cancelling so if your looking for total submersion into the music, get some Noise cancelling headphones. All in all she’s happy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Five months and one side of the headphones goes out. The product started malfunctioning yesterday. Now, whenever I try to connect to a device wirelessly, one side is cut out. Not to mention the constant audio break up. The cord also stopped working after a month. Very disappointing. What a waste of $230!",1.0 out of 5 stars
I wear these headphones everyday to the gym and have been wearing them for a long time now. the sound quality is still amazing. the battery lasts extremely long and it charges very quick when low. one of the earphone covers just started to come undone but with the amount I have been wearing and sweating in them they still work amazing.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I absolutely love these headphones for my workouts. I previously had ear plugs and they were constantly coming out of my ear whenever I sweat so I would have to frequently stop my workouts to put back and readjust them in my ear which got super annoying when i'm trying to concentrate on burning some fat. I've been using these for about a week now and they are really great, i can focus on my workouts and the sound quality is totally bomb. i won't go into all the specs and technical mumbo jumbo cuz i don't know them, but if you're looking for something that stays put and has good sound quality and long battery life you can't go wrong with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I live in NYC, where the temperature at the the winter could be very low. For a couple of days temperature dropped down under 32 deegres Fahrenheit and I have difficulties to use my headphones outside my apartment. After 5 minutes outside, headphones switching off by themself. I can not turn them back on until, I am back to a warmer place for at least 5-10 minutes. I sent a message to Beats by Dre tech support, and I received an answer saying the optimum temperature for using this headphones is above 32 deegres Fahrenheit. So it means that I not gonna be able to use this product through the winter. On my opinion Beats shoul inform customers that they could expect difficulties using this equipment in the cold environment.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I have tried a few different head phones but wanted blue tooth and smaller ear cup size so it didn't look weird while I listed at work. For the price I really dont notice a great sound difference from something like my BOHM headphones at a third of the price. I have glasses and these things kill my ear as they are so tight with no way to loosen them. I would have expect more out of something so pricey.,3.0 out of 5 stars
They were working well the first 2 weeks and then everything went down hill. The sound would start failing in the right ear until it was completely gone and I could only hear from one ear. Then it wouldn’t connect to the Bluetooth on my phone. And after a while I had to call amazon for help on what to do because I had it for a little over a month.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Best wireless headphones hands-down! These are the easiest plug and play headphones ever. Right out of the box, they come with easy to start instructions, how to use the buttons and connect blue tooth. I was up and running in less than 2 minutes. They also fold really well into a case that is included. I'm really happy with the sounds, and they are very much noise-cancelling in my opinion even though I'm not sure it's advertised to be. Very comfortable, long battery life and well worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They look great. If looks are your thing, grab these. If you don’t really care about looks and sound quality is your thing then you can definitely find something better for this price. That’s the biggest issue with Beats.. Price. But even then, the sound isn’t bad, just not good enough for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Poorly made headphones. While the sound quality and noise cancelation are great, within six months of use the padding cover started coming off. For the amount of money spent on these, that shouldn’t have been an issue. I had knockoffs that lasted years.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First problem may not be 100% Beat's fault, however, they are an Apple product. They don't play nice with Bluetooth. Failure and intermittent connection, dropped connection, both on Apple computers. Maybe not Beat's fault, but they are useless for the intended purpose if unable to establish a reliable Bluetooth connection.
Second problem, they are uncomfortably tight on the ears.
Third, the on/off switch offers no tactile functionality. The headphones must be removed and looked at in order to power on (or off).
The sound quality and noise cancelling are fine, but so is every other brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"They worked amazing for the first couple months and then I had trouble with Bluetooth connection, the aux cord thing it comes with had a short in it so it sounds static-y with it in PLUS to top it off the right side stopped working on the headphones. I contacted amazon but they said I had to contact the beats support and the repair would cost almost as much as it would to replace the entire headphones. HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Love Beats overall, have used the wired ones for a few years. And now have the wireless. I highly recommend. These are perfect for people with smaller features. I’ve tried other over the ear headphones and they are huge and look silly. These are compact and cool. The charge lasts a long time. Read the instructions to figure out the headset controls like volume.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Fantastic headphones that quickly became a staple in my workout routine. I enjoy the moderate noise cancellation they provide. It’s not perfect, but I never needed it to be. It blocks just enough noise to allow for a nap on a plane or to focus on your workout in the gym. I really love these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I love the Beats brand. They never fail when it comes to great sound. The quality of these headphones are great. They are very durable. The color is my favorite so that is great too. The battery lasts forever. I usually use these while i'm working out and doing chores around my house and I may have to charge them twice a month. This is my second pair of beats and they are only getting better.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my second set of Beats, the first Blue tooth. These are super comfortable, and easy to install on both my iPhone and iPad. However, since I live in colder climate, if the temps are in the upper to mid 30s, the headphones only last 15 mins at the most. Even if I wear a hoodie, they don't last much longer. This happens when the battery is fully charged, so there must be a shutoff when the headphones hit a certain temp. The battery doesn't drain, it just turns off. I would not buy these again.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"After 6 months, the ear cover has separated and cannot be easily fixed. Apple support was not much help and repair would be at cost plus $100 RT uber ride to a service provider 20 miles away.

"My first time spending $200 on headphones and was impressed with battery life and quality of music for a year. I connect them via Bluetooth as I have on very flight and the right earphone has no sound. I spend every minute u til takeoff trying to google remedies and disconnect/reconnect and reset. I didn’t get them wet, used the case religiously. If I had known they wouldn’t last 13 months I would not have spent that much. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was super excited to get these headphones. After about 20 minutes of wearing them, i took them off and my ears were throbbing! They are very painful to wear. I can't get past the pain so I'll be returning these, which is unfortunate because the sound is amazing and they fit me way better then the Bose soundlink headphones.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Stylish and sound great, but stopped working properly after less than a year. One of the ears goes in and out depending on your head position. A wire is probably a little loose on the inside. As pricey as these are I'd expect them to be more durable after being stored in the case and only being used lightly for a year.

Luckily they still had 6 days left on their one year warranty and Apple repaired them for free.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"My daughter absolutely loves her new Beats, she hasn’t heard a thing anyone has said to her since Christmas morning.
All kidding aside the headphones themselves are very nice. They have amazing sound quality, and they look and feel great. It took my daughter all of 3min to connect to her phone, set them up, and start listening to music.
Will buy another pair for myself, so that I can pretend not to hear my wife.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my first over the ear headphones. They pair easily with my iPhone and my Microsoft Surface Laptop for calls and music on both devices. The sound quality is good and people say they hear me clearly. I haven’t tried outdoor calls yet where it may pick up other environmental sounds.

The only negative is they get a bit uncomfortable on my ears when I wear them for longer periods. I think the ear cushions could be softer.

Next time I’ll consider spending more for more comfortable headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love these. The battery life on these last a reeeallly long time. Ear cups aren’t very large so they don’t comfortably cover the whole ear.

"My cousin needed these for her birthday, so I bought it for her. It was pretty good, she liked these so much. I have also tried these myself and over all sound quality is very good.

Overall, I would say my cousin likes these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Great sound and are compact so they are able to fit into smaller bags when they are folded. The battery lasts pretty long, I was quite surprised. I hardly ever have to charge them and I use them almost daily for the gym. The only complaint I have is they're not comfortable when wearing with glasses. They're a big snug on the ear so they do start to hurt a little when wearing your glasses.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Your used headphones purchased at full price may come with cat fur, earwax and dandruff like mine. That’s nasty.

"My husband loved these. They were great with his low hearing. However, they do not stand up to use while working. They have never been wet, always kept in the case. And just after the end of warranty they quit working. We think it’s because they couldn’t stand up to use while sweating. Can’t come up with any other reason for them to just quit like that after being so well taken care of. It was almost like they shorted. He was wearing them and everything was fine mowing then lawn and the boom, they were dead.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a gift. When I opened them, I was disappointed to see that the black material did not completely cover the ear phones on either side. The beige foam sticks out all around the ear phones on both sides. When I try to stretch the black material across the earphone to cover the foam—it won’t go--it’s WAY too small and will not stay in place.
If they don’t bother to refurbish them enough to make them look good on the outside, it’s doubtful that quality work was done inside. NO ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

"Best bluetooth headphone. Period. Quality is good but most important is you dont need to pair unpair anymore in order to connect to your phone, mac, ipad, watch. It connects to all at once and while listening music from mac if you get a call on iphone then you can just switch to iphone and vice versa. This is a great feature. When I go for jog then I just connect to my watch without unpairing. I have two and my daughter loves it as she can use between her laptop, phone and ipad.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have taken very good care of them . I charged them last night so I could use them today and they would not pair. the pair light wont even come on. so I plugged them in to use and sound only comes out on the right and nothing on the right ! In my opinion . 300.00 is way to much to spend on something you only got to use 4 times. Ive had cheap ear phones that last way longer and when they bite the dust you can afford to replace them .

Material around the are ear headphones are separated after reading many reviews there seems to be ongoing problem I called Apple but they want to hold a credit card on file and have them mailed in.

"Great headphones for all purposes unless you plan on wearing them when the temperature drops near 32°F or below. These headphones have a wonderfully long battery life, effortless connections to I-devices, good sound and great usability. My problem, and it’s a big one, is that is impossible to use these headphones as a wireless device when the temperature drops close to or below freezing. At that point, the headphones turn off automatically anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes later depending on how cold it is. Sometimes, when the temperatures only at 32°, I can get up to 20 to 25 minutes before they turn off. I have called Apple and I have been told that this is typical for battery powered wireless headphones. I have not substantiated this statement with other brands.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"Super great headphones ever have. Was having a wired Philips and a SONY headphone, but always felt painful on both ears because wrapping too tightly to ears. This Beats Solo3 doesn't make such problem to me.

In terms of BT/wireless, it works wonderfully as I have many apple products and the Solo3 connects to all of them with easy set up and very good music quality. The long durability of battery juice and long distance of reception make me thumbs up!! I work in a lab often leave my phone on desk and walk around benches and even cross the hall way to another room. I never get problem to receive BT signals from my iphone7. It's also easy to check battery status using iphone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I had another pair of these that I ordered from Apple that were stolen and I was devastated because I love them so much that I ordered another pair. They are sound cancelling and comfortable sitting over the ear. I was never into bulky headphones like this before but after owning these I probably won't get anything else. I even use them when I shoot my gun because the noise cancelling is that good. I recommend them if you are considering buying them!,5.0 out of 5 stars
Great headset. Flawless pairing with all your apple devices. Legitimate 40 hours battery life and the range across our 3 level home no drops at all. The fatal flaw is i like to walk the dog in winter; if its cold; the unit shuts off purposely at around 32 degrees and no more music for the rest of the walk; i had 2 when i realized this i returned 1. They get more comfortable with continued use; not as comfy as the bose on ear bluetooth. Overall good purchase.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Wow. If you are a bass lover and primarily listen to rap or R&B, you are certainly in for a treat. These look great and although the clarity is not quite as good as other brands such as Bose or Sennheiser, they excel in the bass department. They are sleek and beautiful making these the best looking headphones money can buy and won’t stick out if you so chose to wear them with your favorite outfit. Overall, I strongly recommend these to just about anybody looking for a great overall headphone with great sound quality, bass, battery, aesthetics, and style all in one.",5.0 out of 5 stars

If you like loud music beware. The wireless on these does not allow for loud music. I tested my regular Beats Solo with the same music and phone and the wireless just wont get as loud. I sent them back. Would rather deal with wires instead of not being able to enjoy loud music.,2.0 out of 5 stars

"I have had these for about a year and a half and the left earphone stopped working. If you do research, this is a VERY VERY common problem and it is not an easy fix or you'll have to send it in for repair which costs a significant amount of money.

"Mine are real Beats headphones, so I don't know what the other people are talking about. Great quality sound! Also I love that these are made with a female's head shape in mind, it fits well on a smaller female's head and ears.Very comfortable too! I love the rose gold because it matches my iPhone!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Absolutely best sound I’ve heard from headphones ever! You can’t get any better quality then what I got from Beats. My only issue is that I have large ears so I’m exchanging this pair for a different color for my daughter and I’m getting the larger size.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"No active noise cancellation, the ear cups blocks some sound. I like the 40 hours play on single charge but ears get way too hot and sweaty! Little too tight for long uses, hopefully it will stretch out in time. Used it with the headphone jack and Bluetooth, the Bluetooth never dropped off. Let’s see if the sound quality gets better with use.",3.0 out of 5 stars
I actually like these and I am the furthest thing in the world from a Beats guy. The sound is fun they actually feel good on my head. Are the worth the $300 list price? Probably not but I got mine for $200 and you could probably do better than that. I just hope they hold up. Recommended.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"they fit a little tight on my head which makes it uncomfortable, but otherwise they are great. they charge so fast which is great! when you don’t have the headphones on you can hear what they are playing i would say pretty loudly, but i knew they were supposed to do that but people can easily hear what your listening to even if the it is at a very low volume.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Product has excellent sound quality and quick charging. The audio cord was broken when I received it. Thought no big deal since it was brand new and still under warranty. I was totally mistaken. When I called Apple to get a new cord, I was told that it was already out of warranty by two years. What??? The warranty started when the product was purchased two years ago by the seller (AMAZON) from Apple. Now that I know this, I will be very careful about what I purchase from Amazon. I ended up paying for a new audio cord.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these headphones for my son who is autistic and hopes that it would help cancel out some of the noise around us while he was watching videos or listening to music. So far they have worked wonders and have really helped him be able to be in big groups of people and change from different settings from loud to quiet.,5.0 out of 5 stars

They have felt great so far and I've now had them for a few months and don't notice much wear and tear. They sound amazing still and the battery lasts for more than enough time for whatever activity.

My beats seem pretty legit. The box came sealed with plastic wrap . I also registered them on the Beats website and they popped right up. I returned the Rose Gold pair because I work out too much and the white material seems like it would get dirty too fast. So far I’m satisfied.,4.0 out of 5 stars
I love them they are great. They have a great sound quality and are very comfortable. I was using them in a restaurant and I couldn't hear the music playing in the background. Even though they don't have electric noise canceling any background noise is hard to hear. I like how they came with a cord to use when the headphone dies. Great quality.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I was happy with the headphones, but after 6 months the right side stopped working when being used in bluetooth mode. It works completely fine if using the cable. I did some research online and apparently others have experienced a similar situation. Someone mentioned to try using the cable, but barely touch it to the port and that does bring both back to working, but as soon as you move it will stop working again. For the price of this product i expected better quality that would last.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"This are my new favorite headphones. I have absolutely no complaints. The fact that they come with a detachable cord in case you forget to charge them is very nice (even if most phones can't use the cord anymore).

Also, if you have any kind of problem with them, you get access to Apple's world class customer support. Just to be clear, there was no sarcasm in that last statement, they go above and beyond. I only wish I had purchased an iPhone...",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have had many problems with the pair of beats I ordered. First of all, the hinges started making some weird noise after moderate use of 2 weeks. When the ear cups loosened up, it started leaking so much noise. It is really irritating in college so I will get the studio 3 and give the solo 3 to my gf.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Overrated in my opinion. I've owned these for a 1 year and 3 months and they are now dead. I used these 3 times a week at the gym. For $300.00 I feel like headphones should last a couple years. The once a month charging was nice but I will not be buying any more Beats.,1.0 out of 5 stars
AWESOME! If you’re on the fence about buying these then JUST DO IT! It’s crazy how well they cancel out background noise. Me and my kids “experimented” with it when they first arrived. Unbelievable!

Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves them. They must work really well because she never hears me or my wife calling her when she has them on lol.

"The beats came in what appeared to be good condition, but they do not work to talk on the phone. I don’t know if it’s an issue with the beats themselves, or the actual wire that came with the beats to use for phone calls, but when I plug the cord in, the audio only comes out of one ear and it’s bad quality. Other than this, they look good cosmetically but I was really looking forward to using them for calls as well as normal audio. They are also used. Not worth the money",1.0 out of 5 stars
"UPDATE: I made a phone call to Apple and they helped me to get a replacement pair of Beat Solo3. So far so good...

"I love my beats! They aren’t completely noise cancelling, but they have great sound. Super cute and comes with a storage pouch.

"Great headphones for the price!! I would definitely recommend for anyone that wants good quality Bluetooth headset for a minimal price, but two caveats, one if they are one your ears for too long, they can feel uncomfortable for a minute or so when you take them off, also the volume control on the headset is great but messes up at times making me accidentally pause or skip songs entirely. However, it is overall great and worth the money if you have it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound is not audiophile quality, heavy on bass, and overall good sound quality. But what really makes them great is the technology - the W1 chip, in combination with the iPhone 7 is a great combination. Battery life is insane (in the almost 2 months I have them, I have charged them only twice. Range is also insane while connectivity is a breeze. This is the perfect wireless combination for iPhone 7, hands down.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Not worth the price, sound is not of quality with other headphones of similar pricing, Bluetooth connectivity is spotty in a multiresidential environment and made with cheap materials. Mine broke at the plastic fold mechanism, leather always pulling apart from earpiece and I babied this headset. Band is really tight, ears hurt after less than an hour of use. This came with holographic security, so assume they're real. They are just not worth the price, turns me off to any of their other products, present or future.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"My daughter got these Beats for Christmas 2017, in June 2018 one side of the headphones quit working! Apparently that is common. Apple replaced them free of charge and all was good. Then in January 2019 one side of the extension area broke. Once again I contacted Apple support, however this time instead of a 1 year warranty, the replacements only had a 90 day warranty! So I could pay $129 plus S/H to get them repaired or I could spend another $200 and just buy new ones! Neither option appealed to me!!! VERY FRUSTRATED!!!!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars

We got them repaired and now he hardly used them.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I never dropped my headphone and always treated it nicely, however, after 1.5 years the wireless connection on the right headphone was totally broken and I had to use it only with wire. Finally today, when I was taking it off of my head the right arm broke for no reason and I had to glue it unless it doesn't stay on my head.

"After several weeks of researching, comparing and reading reviews, we bought the Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones. I originally wanted the Bose QuietComfort 35’s or the Beats Studios. I tried them on, tested them out in-store and was having a hard time deciding. I saw a pair of th Solo3’s and tried them on, (not sure how I’d feel about the on-ear versus the over-the-eat style.) I was amazed that the Solo3 sounded just as great as the Bose (in my opinion). While not offering noise canceling, I could still hear most things around me with the Bose and Beats Studios. I felt the sound quality was just as good and I could hear just as much noise with the Solo3’s as the other two with noise-canceling.

"I like the sound quality. I don’t care for how tight they seem to be around my head. I prefer a more loose set of headphones. I have a pair of Powerbeats that I prefer more since they are less bulky. Great sound, bass is also good. They do what they should for the price.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I am in shock at the quality of the headphones I received. I gave them as a gift to my daughter Christmas morning. When she opened them, supposedly brand new, one side was dangling and barely attached at all. Also, the white material in the ear piece looked like it had been worn quite a bit and was ripped away from the ear piece. Such a disappointment since this was the “big” gift for my daughter this year. I’m not sure who is to blame for this fiasco, but it was very frustrating.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I had these headphones for less than a year, and I don't even use them anymore due to their quality and inability to function anymore.

"The BEST headphones I have ever owned. Im a bit of a sucker for looks and brand which people criticize a lot of Beats users for but I say screw those people because you can have both looks AND quality with Beats. I had the beats solo 2 wireless and I cant begin to tell you what a step up the Solo 3's are. The battery life is seriously unbelievable. I use them ranging from 3-4 hours a day and sometimes up to 6 hours (I use them for work) and the battery lasts WEEKS its seriously incredible. When the battery gets low ill charge for 5 minutes and it's back up to 3 dots. It's INCREDIBLE, I dont even think my old Nokia's battery lasted this long! The finish of these headphones is about the same as the Solo 2's except for the gorgeous shiny rose gold accents as opposed to the fully matte finish of the Solo 2's. These headphones look amazing, sound even better, and the battery lasts a ridiculously long time. The price tag is hefty but as someone who uses these every day for work they were worth every penny.

I've noticed some people complaining about the same issue the Solo 2's had. It's uncomfortable to use them for an extended period of time because they are tight. Yes, at first they ARE pretty tight on your skull and are unbearable for over 2 hours. However, over time they DO stretch out and guys this happens to most On-Ear headphones. If you have very large ears I would recommend getting the Studios since they are OVER ear. If you want to speed out the stretch out process just stretch them out over something about the same size as your head and leave them overnight. Repeat this until they are comfy although dont stretch them too much or they will fall easily. I use these now for up to 6 hours at a time and they are very comfy. If you have earrings you might want to take them off before prolonged use, the back of the earrings will be poking into your skull.

Overall these headphones impressed me and this is coming from someone who already owned the great Solo 2's. You will not regret getting these.

*I did NOT receive these for free or discounted price, I paid full price for them and this review and my opinion are MY OWN and not influenced in any way.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality was very good, but the headphones leak a lot of sound so if you're listening in a quiet place, everyone can hear your music. Also, these headphones are not headphones for being active, because they fall off a lot. The material and the quality of them though, is very good. Also very comfortable. Again though, if you plan on doing anything active, these are not the right ones. Update, the rubber cushion on the head strap came off of the headphones",5.0 out of 5 stars

The wireless function does peter out in very cold weather - so if you plan to be walking around in cold weather you may be disappointed. That's a definite thing.

The stability is the only issue I have, everything is perfect",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these because they hold a charge for 40 hours of playback which is true and I'm happy to report it took almost a month of use before needing it's first charge. However, these have been charging for almost 2 days now and it still shows one light on the charging indicator. I've tried several different outlets, chargers and cords.....no luck. Furthermore I've tried to get product support twice now and no luck can't hey anyone to respond. If I get some help in happy to change this review but I'm getting impatient right now.

"I normally purchase from Best Buy, my last pair of solo 3 beats broke...after about 2 years or so. Decided to purchase a new pair, although amazon made me a bit skeptical at first... I decided to purchase a pair. Although the reviews on amazon for this product was
Pretty negative. My package looks REAL, although the case for the beats solo 3 DO NOT come with white inside, at least the last pair I purchased from Best Buy did NOT have the white lining. The packaged was sealed so I’m hoping these are real and not a rip off. For now we’ll see how well these new beats are. I would of given it a 5* but like I said the case for beats looked off.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Noise cancellation worked but after a month of wearing them (how convenient that the return window closed after a month) they started giving my husband BAD headaches.

"First I was spectical that these were even on sale because we all know Beats are overpriced for what you get. Thank being said, since these are discounted they are definitely a great buy. I wouldn't spend $300 on these but I will $220. These are real and they came in the original packaging.

Now for the review. As others have noticed that Beats are very bass heavy, I like this even though I listen to a lot of metal but to some they don't like it. The sound populated is excellent. There aren't any cracks or interruptions at all. These are a very high quality SOUND headphone. My issue isn't with the sound or the Bluetooth connectivity.

These headphones, as other solos are, are built cheap. The sound coming out is great but the design is made out of plastic and i wouldn't recommend anyone going to the gym with these. Get the power beats if you're going to the gym. These feel like they will break and I have a feeling they will If I drop them hard enough. The ear cups re great leather quality and feel comfortable. I wish they went away with the plastic and made all the models like the beats pro were. The material in the design definitely needs work.

The Bluetooth connectivity is marvelous with this W1 chip. The range is insane. I went outside my house and down the street and was still connected without interuption. i don't understand everyone saying connecting is any different. Yes there's a pop up that says connect but all my other bluetooth headphones automatically connect after the initial set up anyway so I don't get this ""amaazing set up"" everyone is talking about.

One more thing I would like to point out are phone calls. The phone calls are so crystal clear. No one can tell I'm using headphones which is hard with Bluetooth nowadays. All around these are a great buy and I would buy them again (not for $300 of course). Sound quality is great, cal quality is great, if you can get over the plastic buy these!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I’ve onky fully charged this set of headphones once since I bought them. I’ve taken them to the gym at least 30 minutes maybe 8-10 times and haven’t had to recharge them.

Some months after the purchase, the left headphone just stopped working when connected to bluetooth, but it worked perfectly fine when I used the 3,5mm jack. Luckily, I managed to get some new ones from Apple.

No. The sound doesn’t sound worth $150. They only charge because they have a name. For $150 they could of fixed up the bass. I’m a bass lover and there wasn’t too much bass for me out of these headphones.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I have been using these headphones at the gym every day for a couple months now and the headphones have gotten loose to the point that I have to hold them in place if I am doing anything like looking down... a bit disappointed as I have taken extremely careful care of them and always put them back in case when not in use.,3.0 out of 5 stars

"These are the second pair of beats I have purchased, and they are great. I know they get a lot of complaints by music professionals as not being ""the"" top quality music output. However, to my amateur ears, I think that they are perfectly fine. The battery lasts forever....I usually have to charge them only every 2-3 weeks, and use them almost every day. Compared to pretty much any other rechargeable product, their battery life is amazing. I don't know how many long haul flights I have planned, and the morning of realized that I had forgotten to charge my ipad/computer...etc. These headphones are great, since they last so long. The music quality is more than sufficient for me, and the fact that they fold up means I can throw them in my purse pretty easily. I use them on my commute, for travel, and when I work out! Great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Item worked for a few months. Now they will not ppwer on and stay on. Upon trying to regoster for support unable to do so. I do not see help offered from Amazon site for assistance.

"Unfortunately, I am going to return these, and for one simple reason: Even with a full charge, the headphones shut off after being in the cold for as little as 15 minutes. And I'm not talking about arctic temps, I'm merely outside in mid-20's degrees, and the battery shuts down. I looked at the beats website and other sites, and this is a well-known design flaw.

I love them. Easy to pair with my car and Android phone. Beautiful. Expensively made. A little tight at first but better tight than lose for years of wear because the leather may give in time and you don't want them falling off. Sound quality could use improvement.

(I was sponsored by a company to buy these headphones) I bought them for 12$ for a month (Tax). The headphones are really great sounding which is always expected by beats. Although the sound quality is great the Plastic that they are made of is poor. The headphones fall off your head easily so playing sports with these headphones are really not recommended.

Bought this headsets 1 year and 3 weeks ago. At first they functioned as advertised. Great sound quality and base. Sad to say right at the year mark started having connection issues and then the right side headphone stopped working. Apple only stands by their product for 1 year. So now I’m left with no headphone or paying the same as a new one to get them fixed. Very disappointed!,1.0 out of 5 stars

With the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, I can walk from one end of my home to the next and even check my mail. There have been times that I forgot they were connected to my S8+ and pull out of the drive-way and they're still connected. The battery life is great and charges quickly. VERY easy to use, no extra buttons to press on accident; just volume up/down, play and pause, and power -that is all you really need. My next pair will be of a different color.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Wanted a decent pair of wireless headphones after always catching a cord at work and breaking other pairs. I looked at a few pairs, these, some Bose headphones and some V-Moda. Honestly these probably had the lowest reviews of the 3. Not bad reviews, but lower than the other two in general so I was hesitant. I also had never read great things about older Beats, but they came down in price some to about 70 less than the other two so I decided to give it a shot.

I am pleasantly surprised. I am by no means an audiophile so that may help, but I think they sound very good. Pretty full sound, I don't think it's the best by any means, but it's a good sound and enjoyable to listen to. Range also seems really good on the bluetooth.

As far as comfort. They definitely could be tight to some. They kind of clamp down on the ears. I don't find this bad, but it's definitely something to consider in a purchase. I think overall they are very comfortable so far. A little hot under the ears after a bit maybe, but not bad.

I would recommend them if you want a decent pair of wireless headphones. Good sound, easy to pair, comfortable. Oh, and it also came with 30 bucks on the itunes store or 3 months of apple music. Since I will use that it's like I saved another 30 bucks on them which really makes them a great deal.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Very annoying thinking that the next morning the headphones will be charged and they aren't. Sometimes the headphones drop the signal. Turn off and on, it comes back. Good sound.",3.0 out of 5 stars

For 309 headphones they suck! I’ve had to have mine replaced 3x bc they won’t hold a charge. Clearly a manufacturer defect. I expected better when appl took over.

"I bought these headphones for my birthday in October 2017 and they stopped working in February. Like they won't charge or turn on.

"I am extremely pleased with this purchase. First of all, it arrived on time and in great condition. I was a bit skeptical about purchasing due to some of the comments that I read, however, I decided to bite the bullet and make the purchase. There were concerns if the headphones were genuine (as in, true Beats)- yes, they are. These Beats by Dre wireless headphones are the best, I do not know why I waited so long to make the purchase! The sound is crisp and clear and my music sounds like it is live.

Setup was not difficult and I like that it automatically pairs with my phone so I can listen to my music. I have a Samsung S7 and it works perfectly- no problems at all.

I purchased these headphones for the gym. I lift weights, spin, and run in them. I have not experienced the issue some people complain about regarding sweating (and I tend to sweat when I am running). My headphones still stay on my head. For those that have that issue, I would recommend tying a scarf on your head. It will help hold the headphones in place.

Overall, I am a satisfied customer.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are trash to put it simply. The sound quality is not as good as I thought it would be.

"I got these a few days ago and they were perfect, I had a long debate on whether I should get the Bose headphones or these Beats. The Beats won out. However after only a few days of ownership they are already malfunctioning. On two separate occasions while working out at the gym the volume levels would change on their own. Which doesn’t seem too bad I guess But considering these headphones are over $200 I was hoping for a good quality product. I am currently waiting on replacements and fingers crossed this doesn’t happen again otherwise I guess I will just go for the Bose.

Update: decided to just get a refund and go with another brand entirely after reading more negative reviews",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless headphones and bought the Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones yesterday. I did a side by side comparison and I gotta say, the Solo 3's sound better.... way better. I know Beats are geared more toward a the low end of the sound spectrum, but I played Hip Hop, Classical, Country, Rock and some Acapela. Every test had the Solo 3's as the clear winner. Even down to the sound isolation, and the Studios have ""noise cancellation"".

There's only one negative, it is the carrying case. Could they not make it a tad bigger?! I feel like just one more centimeter of room would have shaved at least 3 minutes off putting them in the bag. ;)

I have to be transparent, I got these for $210 on another large retailer's site (think the rain forest). Would I pay 300 plus tax? Probably, but the point is, you can't find them for less, just make sure the place you're buying them from is legit.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Heads-up - this is a lengthy review - but when you are considering a headphone at this price you deserve as much review as you can get to help you decide! I will rate by topic so you can also focus on what is most important to you. Let's start with context. These are my first Beats headphones - wired or wireless. They are not of course my first wireless or wired headphones. I have several wireless headphones including Jabra Move and Jaybird BlueBuds X. I also have several wired headphones with my favorites being KEF M500 (on ear) and Oppo PM-2 (over ear). My sound preference in a headphone is crisp and clear highs and mids with a presence and ""definition"" of bass - but not over done. Yea, I'm not a bass-head. So here we go...

WIRELESS (5 / 5):
Right off the bat, this is where these headphone excel, and why I considered and bought them in the first place. They are by far the easiest bluetooth headphones I have used to pair and manage with multiple devices. This of course assumes you are very deep in the Apple eco-system - which I am. I use these headphones with an iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Initial pairing was simple and automatic with my iPhone - place it next to it, turned it on, hit accept and done. Then in seconds the headphone showed up in all my Apple devices! And switching between what device is connected and active is just as easy. I could never get previous wireless headphones I owned to play nice with multiple devices even though they supposedly supported this feature. One wireless headphone always went back and forth between my iPhone and iPad even when I was in the middle of listening to music on my iPhone. Not so with the Solo3! And the range and battery life are incredible. I have owned my Solo3 for over a week and I am still on the initial charge. So hands down wireless performance is the best feature of these headphones.

COMFORT (4 / 5):
The Solo3 is an on-ear headphone and for me they are actually quite comfortable. The leather pads are comfortable and seal well - though they are not as soft as the pads on my KEFs. But maybe they will soften over time. The ""clamping"" of the Solo3 is firm and keeps the headphones very stable during moderate activity but not so tight that they bother my ears at all. The headband liner is comfortable for me too - I don't seem to have the rubbing problem some people have mentioned. And the plastic construction (see again under quality) actually has one plus in that it keeps the headphones light. I almost don't notice they are on my head until... The good seal and firm/thick pads cause my ears to heat up after about 30 mins so I do have to take them off for short ""cool-down"" breaks.

QUALITY (3 / 5):
This is a hard one to judge short term so my rating here is certainly preliminary. Bottom line - admittedly there is a lot of plastic here. Yes, it is a plus under comfort as it keeps the headphones light. But when you get in to this price range you defiantly see more metals and leathers and less plastic. And some wired headphones I have are so solid they have lasted me over a decade! I am not sure I will be able to say that about these headphones. And a 1 year warranty is not very confident - some headphones starting at this price point offer up to 3 years. It would certainly inspire confidence if Beats backed these a bit more and made me feel like the plastic construction was solid and truly there for comfort (weight). That said its too early to bash longevity yet.

SOUND (4 / 5):
Ok now the final and most subjective topic - the sound quality. Recall my sound preference - not a bass-head. When I first heard about these headphones with the new wireless chip - I was interested because of all the hassles I had before with bluetooth headphones. But because they were Beats I struggled to decide to purchase or not. I have not owned Beats because Beats headphones I listened to in the past were definitely too much bass for me - thudding and muffled. But I decided to give it a try - I could always return them. They are not going back! The sound is actually a pleasant surprise. Yes, they are more bass then what I own now - but they sound more balanced then what I remember. You can hear good mids and highs - though they are certainly more reserved. And the spatial separation is very good - these give a full and well spaced sound that makes you feel like you are indeed in the middle of the studio or concert. They excel with more Rock then Classical, so there still is a place for my wired headphones, but I also don't feel like I have to sacrifice sound quality to get wireless convenience.

OVERALL (4 / 5):
Overall, these are very good wireless headphones - they are now my primary go to wireless headphones for sound quality and convenience across all my Apple devices - though I am keeping my set of wireless Jaybirds for intense workouts only. They are even what I turn to now over my wired headphones for most music/podcasts unless I want to immerse myself in some Acoustic, Classical or Jazz where I still prefer my wired options. Value is good - plastic to price ratio is not ideal - but it is offset by the wireless simplicity and sound. If you want a no-compromise wireless experience, you should at least consider these headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars
At this point I have had the headphones 4 months and now they won't connect to Bluetooth. I also tried to connect them to a PC for an update but they will not connect via USB. I have tried to reset the headphones but that didn't work either. In contact with Apple Support now. This is my second pair of Beats and the other ones had to be sent in to be repaired because the right side stopped working.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I got these headphones 4 months ago and for the first two months, the were great. A couple of months in, I started to have some connectivity issues and the earpads started separating from the base. Then the rubber headband started to come off.
Finally, a couple of days ago, the headphones died completely. I charged them to 100% and the still won't turn on. I bought wireless Sol Republic headphones a couple of years ago and they worked fine until I lost them and had to buy new headphones. I got these Beats thinking they'd be an upgrade.... They're cheaply made sold at a ridiculous price. NOT AT ALL WITH THE MONEY. THEY ONLY LASTED FOUR MONTHS!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Hey, So I'm writing my review on 7/18/19. I just received my beats solo 3's in the mail, and I ordered the matte black version. I read the previous comments that stated that people got fake beats in the mail and that sucks. I can't speak for those people, but the pair I received is real. I watched a couple of youtube videos to validate if mine were real and they in fact were.

Just hoping this review helps in case someone read the previous reviews of this product from this seller and was having doubts. I definitely had doubts and was nervous about getting a new pair, but am definitely relieved that mine were real and new. Hope this helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"So I have had these bad boys for about 2 weeks now. Let me tell you they work great! They came in the mail brand new sealed with all the cords and case. These have been used for gym workouts and casual listening. They do become slippery when working out hard, so I would not recommend running with these. I was skeptical at first but I have bad no issues so far. Make sure to buy a hard case as well to keep them safe!! Stand by for a later update!

UPDATE:
Going on 2 months now and they are still running strong. I used them mainly for workouts, running, and plane rides. No issues that I can detect. These are worth the money!

9 month review!!! These are still amazing. No issues yet. Keep in mind these are beats and very fragile.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Be careful. These are advertised as new and sold by Amazon directly; however, when they arrived, they don't work at all. Did not pair initially, then once paired, it went back into pairing mode every 2-3 minutes and kept losing bluetooth. Would not turn on if it was not plugged in and would not do a software update. Contacted Apple for support and it turns out the serial number on the headphones do not match the serial number on the box they came in. Apple says according to the serial number on the device, they were purchased last fall and are NOT new and have already been reported as defective. I'm very angry after spending this much on headphones, I expect them to be new and defect free. Returning for a refund and will shop elsewhere.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these particilar set of headphones for my grandson on May 27,2017. He was so excited! He receieved the headphones on May 29,2017. Three weeks ago the headphones broke . I told him it would be no problem as we bought the Square Trade insurance. Imagine my surprise to find out there was no insurance, In my grandson’s excitement he may not have done so. Nevertheless these expensive headphones should not break in four months time. I saw on order site that there was no restution for this product as the allotted time had expired.
The outcome of the product has really bothered me. Thus this email. I want to warm people against buying these particular set of headphones especially with the Holiday season around the corner. My grandson is almost 15 years old and is a responsible boy with expensive “toys”. $200+ is a lot of money to end up throwing away.

"So sad, I really wanted to like these. I used to love Beats.
The GOOD - And as far as looks go, the are fabulous - I got the rose gold & they are one of the only headphone that I actual feel fashionable wearing.
And they fit my ‘girly’ head; meaning that almost all great headphones seem to be made for guys. Why is that?! Don’t girls want the fabulous sounding headphones too (rhetorical question). Thus these fit comfortably AND they don’t look like I’m about to pilot a helicopter, mow the lawn or on the tarmac directing airplanes.
To repeat - this look and feel awesome!!
Now the BAD - the sound quality is lame. What happened Beats?? Dre?
I’m guessing that these are made to appeal to a wide variety of listening tastes.
Yes, they are probably better than most headphones made for general call/cell phone use.
Oh also GOOD - they pair flawlessly with my iPhone 7. Easy as pie to set up. And they auto connect perfectly. Also, they seem to have a better than most headphones length of Bluetooth connection.
But I must go back to my original point - the bass and over all rich quality of sold is totally lacking. It’s not horrible but it’s like listening to music “lite”, good but not great. Kinda like eating fat frozen yogurt, it isn’t bad, but is it it Haagen-Dazs... not even close",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are not made for anyone looking to seriously exercise in them. After 6 months the fake leather covering the ear pieces came off from sweat and that is even with beats protectors on. It’s now June 2018, so they two month out of the one year warranty and they simply snapped in half when I was taking them off at the gym. I keep them in a hard shell case, not rough on them. They simply feel apart from exposure to sweat during workouts. I’m very VERY disappointed",2.0 out of 5 stars

"When they worked, the sound quality was good, and it didn’t take long to charge. I bought them in August (gave them to my daughter in September for her birthday), and the mic cord came apart almost immediately - the mic cover came off). By January 1st, one side didn’t work. We’d gotten her a set of wired Beats a few years ago, and she treated them very well. The leather wore out around the ears, but there wasn’t a scratch, and she insisted they were still perfect. Because she was so good with them and used them so much, we surprised her with these wireless ones. The problems with the mic and one side were not caused by damage. The glossy finish is still in perfect condition, and she is meticulous with her things. I’m just so disappointed in the quality. The wired ones we bought a few years ago (3 sets) still work; so I guess we won’t be upgrading to wireless anytime soon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"RETURNING!!!! I opened the box and the first thing I noticed was that the headphone case was cheap. I own a pair of the Solo 2 and the case is nice soft material. This feels like a cheap backpack from the dollar store. The biggest problem was the Bluetooth. I would connect to my phone and after only 5 seconds it would disconnect every time, even when I stayed close to my phone it still disconnected within seconds, after trying over 10 times, with 4/5 battery life. I am very disappointed in the company who sent me this junk. Never buying from these people again. Buy from Best Buy. I just saw that they are $10 cheaper, and more trust worthy, straight from the store. 1/10, 0/10 if I could. Buyers Beware!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Beats Solo3 is not the best audio out there, but the crazy thing is that I find myself wearing them more often than another $500 pair of headphones that I have just because they are so convenient and easy. They fold up small and are easy to carry in a backpack, holding up well to pretty tough treatment. The battery lasts forever and if it does die, you can get a whole study session of juice for like 5 minutes of charging. Connecting to my MacBook, iPhone, or iPad is so easy using the M1 chip and the syncing of settings through iCloud that it makes connecting other bluetooth devices seem super cumbersome: Just turn the Solo3 and choose it from your list of devices (no need to disconnect from one device before connecting to the next). And finally, they look good and are very comfortable.

So even though they aren't the best headphones I own, they end up being the ones I use the most because of how convenient, tough, long-lasting, and easy they are. Even though I said the sound isn't the best, the sound is great. The only time that I can discern that they are inferior is head-to-head, and even then, for some types of music these are preferred. They are certainly tuned to handle bass quite well, but they aren't overly bass-heavy as some other reviews indicate. So the sound is more than passable, quite good, and even superior for some music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"A lot of people always seem to nitpick about about the items that they purchase off of Amazon. They always talk about how the sound quality could have been better, they always somehow find a reason that they think it's good enough to complain about the comfortability. Here's what I think about the beats that I bought:

They are one of the best headphones a person can ask for. I do not understand why people tend to complain about the comfortability when they have cushions for your ears. That's what's really important when it comes to wearing headphones that goes over your head. The sound quality is exactly what you would expect from a popular company. The sound quality is amazing along with the different colors that you can buy. When I first bought my headphones I had a question mark over my head because it wasn't turning on, but that was only because it needed to be charged. And that is the beauty of Beats Solo 3, if your headphones is dead, you can also still play music with the wires, just simply plug it in your phone and in your Beats.
I do not know if it is just me because due to the fact that I lost my other pair of Beats it's been such a long time since I touched it let alone wear it, they do seem to feel fragile, all the more reason to place a warranty on an item that happens to feel fragile. Now the question that everybody seems to be asking is ""is it true that it only takes about 5 minutes to charge the headphones completely, and is it true that the battery life last up to 40 hours."" Well the answer depends on how much you use your headphones. There is 5 LED lights that indicates the percentage of your battery of the headphones. If the LED light is on the third light, that just means that you are at least 50 to 75% of battery life left so in other words, it would take a roughly 5 to 10 minutes to charge it which isn't bad. But ultimately it is pretty fast when it comes to charging headphones especially when it turns out to be Wireless. The volume button Works along with the pause and play button, the button that turns on the wireless headphones work. It even makes that musical noise when you are officially connected to your device, and it does it again when you turn it off. I am able to extend the headphones. I am able to fold them which is a definitely a must for me because when I am finished with my headphones for the day I usually fold them.

In conclusion, if something happens to your headphone such as a shortage on the right or left side of the headphones, if you have a warranty all you have to do is just call Apple and they should be able to fix it either call Apple or whatever warranty you are affiliated with. In addition, if you have a computer or a laptop you should download this beat app where you able to update the headphones, I will not go into details but you could always look it up on your spare time. With that being said I'm giving this product and five star and whoever purchase it in the future, I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy what you bought. Not to mention that this was on sale because originally it was $300. Now in the beginning of my review I was talking about how people tend to nitpick and and complain about things that can be easily fixed. And I was very serious about that, they are the ones who bought the item off of Amazon if something happens to that item it doesn't take as much to file a complain and get a refund and get your money back after you give them back what has been broken. Since a lot of people gave it a one-star, I had to double think about me buying this. But when I purchased it it turns out to be great just as I was expecting, no issues to the point where I would want a refund.

Oh and by the way, the true difference between Beats Solo 3 wireless and Studio 3 is that studio 3 have the ability to cancel out noise, solo 3 although you are able to increase your volume the point where you are not able to hear a single thing from the outside world, there is still a chance where despite your volume being all the way up the environment that is around you could be louder than your music. So it is not fully a noise cancellation headphones. But these headphones are beneficial for me because I'm not always in an environment that is loud enough to where I have to blast it up to 100.

And this is where my review ends",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Audio quality is amazing and the design is, of course, slick. However this is the second time I've made a Beats purchase, and I've decided I won't be purchasing anymore of their products. Maybe it's because I use headphones so much, but with both products, they lasted less than half a year before something went wrong. In this case, the cushion was coming apart, and I was having trouble connecting with my laptop several times. Sometimes it would disconnect out of the blue and I would have to restart my laptop to get it to connect again. They weren't very comfortable on my ears either, so I think I'd prefer an over-the-ear headphones because this one squishes down on mine. It's a shame because the audio really is amazing! And I love the design and color, but for this price, it's not worth buying, at least not for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Got 2 pairs at once for me and my girlfriend who use them all the time with our iPhones. I have an iPhone 7 and she has an iPhone 6. I love the new pairing tech apple has in the iPhone 7's and up and these headphones are just great. You can use wires if you want to, which I think maybe makes the base a little better, though I am not sure how accurate that is. Either way, I LOVE THESE headphones! One thing I am surprised about is the battery life on these things. I charge them once a week and often fall asleep with them on Audible and wake up to them still playing all night and still only charge about once a week. The battery life is amazing, the range is amazing, the weight and design, packaging and comfort is just all top notch. I thought the battery life might be due to the W1 chip in my iphone 7 which uses the same tech as the Air Buds, but my girlfriend who uses regular bluetooth with her iPhone 6 reports the same ridiculous battery life. She also says that she charges hers once or twice a week. These are easily the most comfortable beats thus far for over the ear. Head fatigue is almost non existent.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Item arrived on time and well packaged. This was my first ever Beats product and I absolutely love it. These headphones are much better in my opinion than either the Bose noise cancelling headphones or the Jabra headphones I have used in the past. Excellent sound with rich bass and easy to use functions. As others have mentioned these headphones do have a deep bass sound which I think is great. The re-chargebale battery is wonderful and I still have not had to charge them after a month of a fair amount of use. They even fold up to put into the little storage bag that comes with them. These headphones work particularly well with my Apple devices as there is an Apple wireless chip in them. These are great mid-range headphones for a fair price. Quite frankly, these are the best headphones I have ever had. I highly recommend them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Just a heads up, these are knock offs. Pieces were falling apart the second I opened the box so that was my original reason I started the return process. I had no experience with beats so after I decided to return them because they were falling apart I went to Best Buy and tried on a pair, when then I realized they were not the same thing at all. I’m really surprised amazon is allowing this. I didn’t believe the other reviews, I thought they had some accidental fluke. Nope, they’re completely fake and very cheap bad plastic. Save your money and your time. $20 ear buds would be a wiser purchase, or save a little more and buy the real thing.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound was good, but the ear piece part was small for my taste. It put a lot of pressure on the outside of my ears...it wasn't super comfortable. If you have large ears, you may want to try them on first. But sound wise, they were great.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Let me start by saying that I got Beats after they lowered the price to $150 (I think they were $300 or something like that before September 2019). If I had to pay $300 I'd probably send them back and try some other brands known for the sound quality (Bose, Sony). Anyway, for $150 I'm pretty happy with the purchase.
First of all, they are very stylish. If you're looking for a product with a cool design, you won't be disappointed. I personally like the way they look and it feels good to have them on. Beats are easily adjustable, not too heavy, overall they fit pretty well.
It's super easy to connect them to all Apple devices. iPhone, iPad, MacBook, you name it. I connect them to a few different devices and never have any issues.
Unfortunately, the sound is not that great. It's not bad but I personally don't see any difference between beats and regular AirPods. I was expecting more for $300 headphones. Also, I don't recommend using beats when you work out and move a lot (running, jumping, cardio exercises). Other than that I have nothing to complain about. I think they are worth $150 but this review would be way different if the price was 2x higher.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are great! They are authentic and come in the original packaging. I use them mostly to study (I listen to static noise) and I wear them during my runs. They fit a little snug, but that may be because I have a large head. They feel most comfortable without my glasses and earrings.
When I listen to music the sound quality is amazing. I put them on when I am cooking and it really puts me in the groove. My chef skills have definitely been enhanced following the purchase of these headphones. If you can't cook, buy Beats for some good eats!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This purchase was a part of my rookie intro into headphones. I travel about 80% of the time with my job, airborne, and was having a hard time finding headphones that were both compact and functional. I bought these on a whim during Amazon prime day - since they were on sale - and only wore them a handful of times. They are nice and have good sound quality, but after only 30 minutes of use, start to REALLY hurt your ears... Especially since they sit right on top of your ears. To put it into perspective - I am a petite framed female with normal to small ears. I imagine if they are uncomfortable on me (5’2 / Small oval shaped head) they would certainly be uncomfortable on most people. I ended up purchasing Bose QuietComfort 35. The price point hurt, but holy %*!@ has it been worth it. I can wear my Bose headphones all day (literally) with zero discomfort. Plus, you can remotely manage them with their app. My advice - spend the extra money and buy something else. Even my cheap pair of Sony headphones were more comfortable than the Beats. Not hating - hoping this helps.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Like many others, I read the reviews of all products and filter out the reviews I feel are retaliatory or based on a shipping/seller problem verses a product issue. BUT, in this case my biggest and only issue with the Beats Solo3 is the product! It's made from cheap materials and not as impressive as the marketing campaign that launched the Beats brand. They are made of flimsy plastic, the ear cushions are made of foam and pleather that becomes oily, have fit issues, fiction and performance problems and the additional heat they generate around your ears is astonishing (maybe i should use these while snowboarding)! I've had mine for 5 months and shocked on how many issues I've had so far. Some background, I buy A LOT of items through Amazon and other retailers (some people might say I have a problem, I say I have my PhD) and this one of the worst purchases I've made! Issues I've experienced so far include; won't charge, won't turn on, won't turn off, Bluetooth not connecting to an iPhone or the car, pleather ear covering ripped on the left ear, plastic sleeve housing left speaker broke and now held together with rubber bands (about to upgrade them to electrical tape though 👍🏼) now the entire left ear housing has broken and will also get the electrical tape treatment. DO NOT waste your money or PLEASE go into a store so you can see them for yourselves and you'll be prepared for what your getting. I wish I could still return mine......procrastination gets you every time!!!

"I keep it simple sounds good battery life is good they are comfortable I don't like headphones that cover my entire ear cause they make my ears hot and I cant keep them on for long periods of times so there not many options out there for on ear headphones really most of them are like studio headphones and the ones that are not they are not stylish, things I don't like much are they slip off my head every time I bend they are slippery they over price in my opinion the adjustable size looks cheap the open up just grabbing it by accident for me they are delicate headphone you got to be careful with them if you want them to last. so for me they are ok cause my options are limited and I bought this with a amazon gift card so it was more like a gift didn't use my own money.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I used to have the Solo 2 wired beats and, after many cable replacements, I figured an upgrade to the wireless would be my solution. After nearly a year without beats, considering my stubborn self didn't want to pay for yet another replacement cable, getting back to these was like heaven. They sound absolutely amazing, providing a wide range and and depth in the music. I barely put them up past half the volume and am just stunned by the quality. Even though the Solo 2 were already fantastic, they truly outdid themselves on the Solo 3.

My only issue, which I'm unsure if it's an issue for everyone or just me, is that the clip for the bag and accessories was rather loose and did not close correctly. This caused me to lose all of my accessories and the bag. Luckily I had been wearing the beats at the time so I didn't lose those but I was incredibly upset that I could have and did lose some stuff. However, Amazon support was great and solved the problem quickly.

All in all, I really love these headphones so much. They have a great feel and sound and the ability to go cordless is such a fantastic feeling.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these headsets to replace a set of in ear headsets (Mpow) that just never quite were satisfactory for use at the gym and for general use. Never thought an over the ear product would work for me until I read the reviews on these Beats Solo 3 by Dr. Dre. So I had to try them.
This is my initial unsolicited review after about a week. I have the matte black color, which sometimes Amazon varies in price to drive choice. I got mine at a good time, though- Cyber sales- so it was a very competitive price.
What did I expect going in? Before I opened the box (quite a package, if you're into that sort of thing!) had good confidence that the bass sound quality would be outstanding from reputation of the Dr. Dre Beats brand. Rewarded in that regard and many other aspects as well.
Besides that though, there is a wired connection cable, and a charging cable packed inside and all the 'foo-foo' packaging you might expect from Apple, just to mention accessories you might expect.
I'm going to concentrate on what most people buy a headset for. So let's get on to the important stuff:
• Sound quality. It's unlike and greater than 90% of the headsets I have used. As an audio engineer (my past life) I have used plenty. The size of the cups is not an unusual one if you wear a lot of headsets- just over the ear as opposed a full surround, found I prefer this style these days.
• Great build quality/design of the ear cups. Fit well and very comfortable. I can easily wear for an hour at a time. After that, they begin to feel warm-ish (read I want to take them off for awhile). Most of my wear is inside the gym, haven't gone outside for a run with them, may be different impression.
• Outstanding battery life. I got them at what appeared to be 100%, apparently they weren't though. On my iPhone (11 Pro) when I looked, the power read 50%. SO I thought to run them down to the ground. I put them on days later and it read 25%. Used further for a work out for 1.5 hours and still good (20%). Gave up and recharged 'em. I will report back on a running time after full charge.
• Isolation. An over ear headphone has MUCH BETTER isolation from external sound by it's nature of the cups surrounding the ear. I my opinion these headsets DO NOT need further noise cancellation, with the possible exception of air travel. Further noise cancellation would likely affect sound quality. Have not tried the noise cancellation version which is MUCH more expensive. I have a pair of Sony noise cancelling over-the-ear type headsets for travel that do not sound as good as these but cancel plane noise VERY WELL. The thing is, they don't sound as good.
• Controls and pairing to several devices. Bluetooth is flawless and fast to pair to new devices (admittedly all Apple). Controls on the headset (pause-play,volume up/down) are VERY responsive. I did find that going from one device paired to another always requires that the second pairing be connected at the device again. The headset want to stay paired to the original device until a new device is paired. Once you have that concept it's easy to switch between sources.
• Microphone on a call sounds great to the caller and the caller sounds great in the headsets. I don't know where the mic is exactly but wherever, it works!
Listening test. I'm listening to the headsets as I write this review. I enjoy music and my favorite sounds are nothing short of magnificent played on these headsets. My positives about that are fabulous bass (expected). My only criticism is the ""mushy"" highs. So I had to engage an equalizer to improve the highs for me. On Music app you can fool with the settings. I pictured what works for me and I admit to some hearing loss, so what it means to you is only that there is no actual reproduction of ultra low bass (<30-40Hz, I'm guessing) or ultrahigh frequencies (>12KHz), which I think is to be expected on these type headphones. What is there is fairly well flat but could use boosting (again for me) and tweaking in the mid-range high frequencies. I feel that resulted in a major improvement. In my case with known music as the source and still with a bit of bass coloration, I found a sweet spot, to EQ settings as shown in the picture.
Review conclusion. An outstanding quality product! If there 4.75 stars I would give it that overall rating. Actual Rating. I'm taking off 1 star overall for less than perfect sound, likewise the bass quality because it was too overpowering out of the box and affected the frequency response. Apple knows something about audio and many folks will disagree with me. OK. My fix was minor on the computer source. However the fix for iDevices is not as easy, though I'm betting there is an app for that or soon will be because it's worth doing.
I may just get that app and use it, because these headsets are a pleasure to wear and use.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love these headphones, we will buy another Beats Solo3 next month after we save up. A bit spendy as compared to Sony 950 set that we returned last week, but absolutely night and day difference in sound quality. The Sony set had superb bass, but there was a trade off as treble and midrange suffered quite a bit (lacking). These Solo3 have a very balanced and deep bass, as well as detailed midrange and treble. Probably the treble was a tiny bit lacking, but full treble can be harsh I have found. I was thinking my Planetronics Backbeat did better with overall sound but after listening to them again to compare, I found the Solo3 has the mid and highs covered better as it takes the ""harshness"" out of a lot of it. Kind of cuts off the harshness of not only the treble and mids, but also the bass . No overpowering bass, but totally enough to make me happy . Listen to a lot of dubstep, and these are very pleasant sounding with that genre of music !!

Folding them up to put in the carry case didn't feel like I was going to break them, which I was worried about before I purchased. For the price they can not be beat, very happy (oh did I say that already) ? lol",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Update January 18 2019
After having to have my beats replaced FIVE times in less than a year, a person in a higher position talked to me. He made sure I got a new pair of headphones AND a new warranty. I did send them in for a replacement two days ago, because the ear coverings had started coming off again and would not stay in with the card trick. So I had that done while it was under warranty. I know that these beats won’t last forever, I am currently seeking a better alternative for when that happens.

Let me first say, I love my beats. The sound is much better than the past beats headphones. But the build quality is horrible. I knew they didn’t have the best build, but the fact that I’ve had to have my solo 3’s replaced twice in less than a year is absolutely ridiculous. I take very good care of my headphones, I’m not rough with them at all. These are way too expensive for the quality you’re getting. At least apple has been helpful.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited a year to post a review as I wanted to see if they would last. Yes the sound is great. Yes the noise reduction is wonderful, but if they only last a year, they are not worth the price! I've seen comment after comment from Beats owners that after a year or less couldn't hear sound from one side. To have them repaired is $129. There are you tube videos showing you how to tear apart the faltering side and pull wires, solder and put it back together, but if you don't have the skill set, you're stuck with Beats that only have sound in one ear. Get a less expensive pair of headphones. You'll be so much happier if they break and you are not out $229",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I rearrange my home office recently. This office is my primary workplace. In the rearrangement, my computer hutch and my desk are on opposite walls. As I moved back and forth my old standby Grado SR60 cans ended up pulling out of the headphone jack or worse pulling the computer on the floor. I was looking at the Beasts solo 3 wireless as they seemed very similar to the Grados. The price was right on Prime day.

These are on ear cans so I don't expect perfect noise cancellation. That said the experience is better than expected. The sound excellent and very transparent. I can go from bass heavy rock to string quartets without needing adjustments. Wearing duration is very good, with two to three hours with fatigue. Learned not to bend too far forward or the headphones will fall off. Bonus finding, these headphones are very good for phone calls. I was listening when paired to my iPhone when I had a phone consultation. I forgot I was wearing the beats and when I realized I did not make the switch to my usual phone headset I asked about my voice clarity. I was told the call was very clear.
Finally, the pairing to my MacBook Pro and iPhone was very easy and switching between devices is just a matter of going the menu on the device I want use and selecting the Beats.

For the environment when I use these headphones they are exactly what I want. There tendency to slip off when bending and noise leakage make them a poor choice when I am woodworking.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I kicked around the idea of buying these after I got my iPhone X, which lacks an earphone jack. At first I didn't want to spend another couple hundred dollars after I'd just spent $1200 on the phone, but I bought these on impulse while waiting for a delayed flight last weekend. I am really happy I did. I didn't read any of the reviews until after I'd made the purchase so I was concerned for....say, 30 seconds that I'd get a fake. But let me say with absolute certainty: THESE ARE REAL. I feel bad for people who ended up with knock-offs, but I got what I paid for.

This is actually my second pair of Beats, since I've had the ""sport"" version for several years. No, those ones did not wear out - they're still going strong for four years now, but I got them to wear while training for marathons and running on the road where I wanted to be very aware of traffic and my surroundings. Since then, I've migrated more to lifting and wanted headphones that would block out outside noise and let me get into my zone uninterrupted. As a gal lifting by herself, the chatter from the ""bros"" on the weight floor is still a little intimidating to me but these Beats do just the trick to help me tune that out, pay attention to only what I am doing, but still have enough awareness of what's going on around me so that I'm not the rude one who looks like she can't share space and the equipment.

The battery life is much longer than I expected and probably does approach 40 hrs like the product description says. They came fully charged and I first used them on a Monday and think I probably didn't actually turn them off but the battery still had juice when I picked them back up on Wednesday. They are a little heavier than I expected, but still very comfortable. I am not a musician and can't weigh in on the nuances of sound quality, but I can say that my music sounds phenomenal in these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for Christmas at the behest of my son. Overall sound quality is very good, as is the battery life. Where we ran into problems is when the right side quit working after 9 months. A quick internet search revealed we were not alone with this issue. Apple support was initially happy to send them off for warranty service but quickly denied coverage for a small separation of the left side housing. Seemed trivial but Apple was firm. For $200 I think you can do better. First and last pair of Beats for us.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these headphones exactly two years ago today. They now experience random disconnecting and won't repair to an already paired iDevice. At first, these were awesome! The pairing experience with an iDevice is so fluid and seamless. Pairing it to any of your other iCloud-connected devices is so easy. I went from my iPhone to my iPad to my Apple TV all in a day. The battery life is also amazing. I think I went 4 months without charging it at one point. Fast forward to today and I am really disappointed. My Solo 3s started to disconnect in the middle of songs and it wouldn't repair. I tried everything, even resetting the device and forgetting it on my iPhone. That worked at first but that solution would only last a day. I contacted Apple Support and they offered to replace it for $129 plus tax. Now that sounds like a good deal at first, but consider that I already spent $300 on these 2 years ago. I expect these headphones to last at least 5 years. And I took great care of these headphones, they were never exposed to water, and I never worked out with them (they aren't water resistant!). I think I am done with Beats, and instead, I will now take my $129 plus tax and use it towards the purchase of a Bose or Sony headphones. Hopefully, they have better build quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"After purchasing Beats Solo 3's I attempted to buy AppleCare+ at the Apple Store within the 60 day window. Apple informs me that the ""purchase date"" was more than 60 days (in fact is was 120 days prior to my purchase date). Further, trying to get a US representative is nearly impossible. Instead you are placed on hold for more than thirty minutes only to once again being connected to a off-shore representative.

"Not at all worth your $300. Seriously I would not consider purchasing these ever again, especially after the lack of support I received from Apple on them.

I purchased these originally in November of 2017. In June of 2018 I had an issue where audio stopped working completely with one of the ears (I can't remember if it was the right ear or the left ear). I brought them into the Apple Store they looked them over and determined they could be sent in. About 10 days later I received the headphones in the mail, but it was never clear if they were mine or a replacement pair that I got back (if they weren't mine, why did it take so long, why not just give me a new pair right there in the store?).

Fast forward to now, May 2019. I'm having the same exact issue. The audio in the right ear has stopped working. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps they ask you to perform (try on multiple devices, try with the cable connecting it to a device, reset the headphones, etc.). I brought them into the Apple Store, this time I'm told that my only option is to pay $129 for a replacement pair. Apple will sell you a new pair (with only a 90 day warranty) for $129 since you previously purchased this product.

Apparently the original product has a 1 year warranty on it. The replacement/repaired product has a 90 day warranty or whatever is left on your original warranty, whichever one is longer. So at this point I'm outside that window. I connected with Apple Support today, this time online, to go through the same process to see if I could find any other solutions. Same result, I can purchase the replacements for $129 which will only have a 90 day warranty on them.

So two pair of these headphones got me from November 2017 to May 2019, a total of 18 months. I'm not sure how Apple can justify that it's alright for $300 headphones to be completely worthless after a total of 18 months. Considering I had two pair, so they seem to really last roughly 9 months. I will never buy another Beats product again and I'm disappointed that I already own so many other Apple products :(.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Both my beats solo 2 and 3 stopped working between 12-18 moths. Same issue with the right earphone losing hearing without being dropped, mistreated, or abused. The first I assumed was a defect. Having it happen again, I’m convinced it’s designed with a flaw to force upgrades and stimulate purchases. Contacted apple support and after shipping both out at a cost of $130 each to repair, they refused and simply told me to purchase new ones. Poor product and even worse customer service from apple. Bought the Bose qc 3 in the hope that with spending $350, the products quality will mesh with the price better than Beats cheaply made product.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"I was hesitant to spend so much money on a pair of headphones. I've always just used the headphones that came with my iPhone. Now that the iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack in the phone, I've been looking for wireless ones so I wouldn't have to search for the little adapter.

They're beautiful and well made but my cheap wire earbuds that I was replacing blow them away... I'm glad I kept my cheap earbuds.

Now I'll go to maybe a Bluetooth earbud or wire system... Just something that has volume so I don't hear all the noise going on when I workout.

"Let me start with a couple things. 1) my phone that I use these headphones with is a galaxy note 8. 2) this is my first purchase of any set of headphones that cost more than 40 dollars so high end by my standards.
With that out of the way these are not all I was expecting for such a highly known brand. I have a pair of in ear wireless headphones with what seem to me about the same sound quality and for a tenth of the price. (They are 20 bucks). These are significantly better at noise cancelling which I can appreciate. However some things I have problems with besides the quality of sound is they are tolerable to wear for a period of time with glasses but after that period they can start causing a headache and just be extremely uncomfortable. With that said they do hold secure to my head and don't really move unless I'm moving my head a lot. I've been using them on and off for 3 days now and still haven't charged them (and they came with only a half charge at that) which is incredible to me. The other problem I have is it is extremely catered to Apple I believe. When in Bluetooth mode I had a difficult time connecting even with instructions, the volume up and down/ play pause button is a hit and miss whether it wants to work or not, and trying to go back a song does not work at all. It usually just skips 3 or 4 songs ahead. When it is connected via the wire the button on the wire is useless unless I need to pause and play. The volume buttons do not work and i cannot skip or go back songs. The final problem I had is the case. It is very limited in space which I can appreciate for on the go and packing in my backpack. However getting them into it's case can be much harder than is required.
With that being said, I do actually like these headphones and will keep them. They are a good pair of headphones. The negatives I've included have primarily been the biggest problems that I've run into.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"So i thought i had something wrong with my ears but nope it's the headphones.

I've lost sleep, work concentration and money over these. Sound quality is better than other headphones I've used but none of those $40 headphones have ever made me loose sleep. Now I can't return them after using them for one month.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I realize that these are not inexpensive headphones. I wanted really decent headphones that had a really large bass response. Beats are known for their quality and so that's what I was looking for. Fast charging that will last for a long time, meaning that I only seem to need to charge it every few days, and I use it a lot. Also very beautiful. It has invisible controls on one side of the headset, meaning that if you press one of the sides things will happen, like volume control, and most importantly, if push twice it will skip to the next song depending on how you have your source music set. I have mine set to play randomly so I don't know what is playing next. That is controlled by your unit, not the headphones. These are Bluetooth headphones and you can hook them up to anything that Bluetooth's. It also has an incredible range on it. This is my second apartment I have had them at and it actually goes perfectly from floor to floor right through the cement without sound deterioration of any kind. No I don't know what the range is, and so it may depend on your own situation, but I simply do not think that there are better headphones out there for the price. Like I said, if you are looking for excellent bass response, and I like bass, because I listen to a lot of rock 'n roll and heavy metal, then these headphones are the right ones to get. They are also very sturdy and they fold up so if need be you can put them in your coat pocket. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had these since August 2017 and I loved them but I've noticed in the last few months, they don't seem as great.

I'll pause the song, push the little button on the headset, then push play on iTunes and they'll be fine again for a while. And then some nights I can't get them to work at all.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"So the first thing to know about Beats is that they are optimized/equalized before you buy them. You cannot equalize Beats. That's their whole selling point is that you dont need to. Now having said that the question must be asked ""is this a good thing?"" And the answer is, to some degree at least, yes. These headphones are extremely well made and durable and the sound quality is by far the best I've heard yet. The battery life is insane. They advertise a 40 hour battery life at a full charge and up to 3 hours of battery life with just 5 minutes of charging. As far as I can tell these numbers are lower than the actual battery life as on my first full charge i didnt need to charge them for almost a month all while listening to them 4+ hours a day for at least 5 days a week. The only issue with these headphones is these are really made for rap/hip hop. Now don't get me wrong, I have listened to metal, country, pop, classic rock etc on them and it still sounds extremely good, but hardcore audiophiles may not like the inability to equalize the headphones themselves. All in all these are by far the best headphones I've ever owned and definitely are worth the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones have decent sound quality for 1) bluetooth and 2) casual listening. They are on-the-ear style that come with a 3.5mm cable (for plug-in listening and full audio quality), a nifty carrying case. What I enjoy, however, is the pairing with Apple devices via their W2 chip. I recommend these for people with Apple devices (particularly if you have more than one). If you aren't an Apple user or have a mixed ecosystem, check out Sennheiser's HD series for better options.

As they are ""on-the-ear"" phones, you may experience fatigue after several hours. By that point, giving your ears a break (for any headphones) for a few minutes will be helpful.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"The Basics -
Build quality: 8/10
Sound quality: 7/10
Comfort: 7/10
Battery: 10/10
Usability: 8/10

I'm going to start with the build quality, which I think is excellent. Everything from the packaging to the ear pads is looks and feels well constructed. The design of the headphones is also very simple, so there is not a lot of variation in texture/materials, which gives the headphones their slick and stylish look. The only thing I wasn't very impressed with was the soft shell carrying case, which is only okay. It's good for keeping the headphones from getting tangled or caught on stuff in a bag or pack but offers very little actual protection.

Sound quality: 7/10
For on-ear headphones, the sound quality is pretty good. But at the price point, there are other headphones you could get that have better sound quality. That being said, these definitely perform well and I enjoy listening to them.

Comfort: 7/10
As with pretty much any on-ear headphone, these do start to get uncomfortable to wear after a while. However, I find that I can wear them a good 2-3 hours before they start to get tiring on my ears. I also find that I rarely use them for that long, as when I'm at work or somewhere I'm sitting, I probably won't be using these. So they're great for traveling, around the yard or house, at school, etc, but probably not a primary headphone.

Battery: 10/10
The battery on these is amazing. I believe the battery is listed for 40 hours of use, and I would say that's about accurate. I have yet to have the battery die,

Usability: 8/10
The power button is small but easy to locate, the headphones connect super fast to my phone (almost instantly), and the play/skip and volume controls are accessible and easy to navigate without any thought.

Overall I've been super happy with these and would recommend them to any looking for a stylish and good sounding pair of school/travel headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are very good headphones, but for the steep price, I was a little disappointed. Main points:

1. SOUND QUALITY: This is the most important part of the experience and this is the downfall of the Solo3. The base is too overwhelming, resulting in an overall muddy sound. I was actually quite surprised at how bass heavy these were the moment I first turned them on. Mid range and tenor sound tight and crisp without flaws, but its simply a bit over weighed by the intense bass. Of course this is a subjective determination...but count me in in the ""this is too much bass"" group.

2. WEAR: These are a bit heavy, more so than an accompanying pair of wired headphones, but the weight in itself is not intrusive. The headphones fit tightly, but after some time the ear pads do slightly pinch my lower earlobes. Its not a deal breaker, but again, I was expecting something engineered flawlessly for comfort for the price.

3. CONNECTIVITY / BATTERY LIFE: Excellent coverage on these for blue tooth. I can walk almost up to 10 meters away in a different room before these start fritzing out. A huge plus is the very long battery life. As I listen to music at work non-stop, I was sick of having to recharge headphones every 5-6 hours or so. I charge these once and they last several days and into the weekend as well sometimes.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I recently re purchase beats solo 3 black hoping for a great experience. Out of the box everything was great and working without any issue. Travel to San Francisco didn’t have any issue. On my return trip back to my home state I experience charging issue with the beats solo 3 headphones where the battery would not take a charge and stayed on red. I tried different cables and used an ac to USB charger still same results. I stop by apple and they would have to send it out for two weeks I was still under 30 day purchase period and had them returned. I waited and purchase another pair recently hoping for a great experience worked great no issues until today. My headphone were charging all night with no issue 5 white lights. Went to the gym notice it was at 3 white light s strange. 1 hours of working out the headphones stop working. Stop by apple they said try to reset and charge again if issue continue they would send it out for service two weeks. Came to the office and attempted to reset and charge my beats solo 3. The unit would not charge pass 1 white light for 2 hours. There seems to be issue with beats solo 3 not sure what it could be but I will wait before purchasing again.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Beats are great when it comes to sound quality, mobility and battery life. The design is beautiful, they fold compactly and come with an aux cable so they can be used plugged in to things such as console controllers, monitors, laptops etc. The connectivity with my iPhone is great and the bluetooth range is impressive ( I was able to leave my phone on one floor of the house and go in to the basement and did not lose connection.) There are two down sides to these headphones however, the somewhat fragile folding system and the clamping weight. Basically you fold the headphones over on to themselves to store them and it seems like you can easily break them this way if you aren't careful. The clamping weight is the pressure these headphones put on your ears while they're on. After anywhere between 20-40 minutes of use, I usually have to take them off and readjust them to ease ear soreness. The heavy clamping weight helps these headphones stay on your ears however while moving around/exercising but unfortunately hurts your ears a lot.

Pros:
- Great mobility
- Great connectivity
- Great sound quality
- Great battery life

Cons:
- Fragile design
- Clamping weight (hurts ears over time)
- Price (if looking for budget headphones or if you don't get them on sale like I did)

Hope this review helps.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not an audiophile but husband is and currently own real great sounding headphones. I've got this ship n sold by amazon and it's 100% authentic and was able to register. We're not an apple household and I only bought this out of long time curiousity and it's battery life.
Coming from Sony and other high end brands, this beats is not really that special audio wise. The bass is good but it is too bass-y for my liking I find it annoying sometimes. It sounds great in upbeat songs because of heavy bass but too muddy and noisy in mellows. I am more into soul, jazz, classical, pop, country, acoustic, 70s 80s classics and the likes so this isn't my go to headphone. I cannot stand this headphone when it comes to slow songs. When I'm in a mood for some upbeat reggae then this is it.
It's overall nice quality, sound is good, just not $200 let alone 300 good. People saying this is the best in market probably never tried the really good ones out there (and it's okay). Glad I bought this at a deep sale price or I'd be crying by now. My $100 Sony & Bose sounds just as good and even better and clearer on most songs in my list. If we have same taste in music, look for something else, you'll find some with same sound quality but at a significantly lower price. And if you want to buy this, do yourself a favor, buy this on sale coz it's really not worth it's regular price. It's only worth $150 tops and that's already a stretch. If you've never owned expensive headphones and been saving $ to buy one then please look somewhere else: sony, bose, audioTec, bowers, beyerdynamic, sennheiser.
I'm keeping this not because of the sound but for my upcoming long international travel. I needed something that will survive me forever without charging since I'll be in the airport and plane for 2 days. The battery life is aweeesome- best out of all my bluetooth headphones!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are the real deal. Once I turned on the Bluetooth on my phone the Beats Solo software automatically appeared. It seamlessly connected to my Apple Watch as well. The Matte Black comes with grey lettering on top which also indicates that it is real. The sound is nice and crisp, especially with some old school Metallica. The headphones feel extremely comfortable, sturdy and light.

UPDATE: The USB BROKE IN ONE DAY. AMAZON REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED ME THAT ITEM IS REFURBISHED and NEW WHICH WAS ADVERTISED.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"It might seem harsh to ding the headphones for a software issue, but the reason you're paying a premium on these headphones is for the W1 chip, which makes it integrate better into the Apple ecosystem. If you're on android, there are better quality headphones for the price.

The W1 chip does let switching between apple devices work seamlessly, but the new iOS update (that I understand they have no intention of fixing) makes these completely unusable. I had to dismiss this popup 50 times a day whenever my headphones are near an iOS device. This happens on a device that's currently connected OR NOT. And when it's not, there's not even an option to connect. I have to dismiss this dialog in order to manually connect.

This is not a seamless experience. If I open my phone I want information quickly, I don't want to be reminded that my headphones exist. Do Not Disturb mode doesn't even and this misery.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Amazing headphones, I use them to do transcription and I am able to hear every single word without the strain or difficulties I had with previous headphones. The color is gorgeous and I love that it came with a case, cords and even a clip to put on the bag for when I'm traveling. The soft inner cushions for the ears are superb and very comfortable. I was worried that the white would be difficult to keep clean or would not look good but once I received them I saw that this would not be an issue. Controls on the headset are very easy to use, quick to connect to computer, laptop or cell phone and the sound quality is superb. I am very pleased with these amazing head phones and they truly are worth the splurge.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Overpriced. You can either buy for the beats name or spend half the amount of money and get something equal, if not better quality. These will break easily due to being made of cheap material. Then if you try to fix them yourself, you will need a whole set up (Soldering kit, replacement parts, and a steady hand). You’ve been warned.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"As a senior citizen (69yrs) I don't like ear buds. This was everything I wanted & more. I love the rose gold color & the sound was phenomenal!!! Unfortunately, on Feb. 4, 2018 our house burned down; we lost everything except the clothes we had on. Now I'm looking to replace some of the things I lost. This is first on my list.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Recently purchased these and have owned them for about a month. Love them and the sound quality for the most part; however, the left half of the headphones have completely blown out without warning, so now only the right side is producing sound. Very disappointed in the quality of these for the price that was paid for them. Who wants to listen to music with only sound going into one ear?",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not a headphone expert and maybe I was expecting there to be a live concert in my ears but these haven't wowed me in the slightest. The ear cups are small and can get pretty uncomfortable how they sit on your ears, the sound is just ok. Not bad but like I said, I got just as good of a sound from a less expensive pair and to top it off, they pull my hair out every time I take them off. With everything considered, I wouldn't buy them again. I'm giving them to my kids and whatever happens to them, happens. I should have stayed with my less expensive brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I really wanted these and have owned Beats Solo2 that were great. I had to return this product 3 TIMES!!! So aggravating they do not work like they used to and have failed to the point of my having to return. Lost connections and wouldn't reconnect; I have a new Iphone and it didn't work as stated in pairing; you're supposed to just open them and they automatically put a box popup on your phone where you say connect. Worked once. Then when they failed, I totally reset and went to start over totally, and no popup whatsoever. I am beginning to think Apple has done something to mess these things up since they now own the company. Anyway, cannot recommend them.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"First review, more reviews to come the longer I wear This head set.
Wore them to the gym, they did not shift in any direction while wearing them. I wear glasses, I placed then just below my upper earlobe, no year pain after an hour in the gym.
Sound was great, kept it at 3/4 volume, was just the right level to get going, but low enough to hear if someone was trying to tell me something.
Quality feels good and durable.
I have an Android phone, easy to connect to. I also have a Kindle, also a breeze to connect.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones did not disappoint. There is not one bad thing I can say about them. Great quality. Great sound. I had no problem pairing them to my iPhone and MacBook. And yes, THEY ARE AUTHENTIC. I would suggest avoiding buying them from third party sellers, I believe that is why some people are receiving knockoffs. I would also suggest avoiding buying used Beats. Buy them new if you want to be sure you receive the authentic ones. For some reason the (white and gold) Beats were $30 cheaper when I bought them... they went up in price the day after I purchased them. If you happen to see them for a great deal, don't hesitate to buy them. If you're still worried about getting a knockoff, you can always price match at Best Buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones arrived today. After wearing them off and on throughout the day, I have enjoyed their quality in materials and the sound quality is great. I was worried that they'd be heavy on bass, but they're a good balance. I've listened to several genres of music and even some podcasts and the quality is consistent throughout all areas. My only complaint is that these headphones are not comfortable to wear for extended periods. After 30-45 minutes, they start to hurt becuase they put a decent amount of pressure on my ears. This is kind of a bummer because I bought these to use while doing online classes and school work.
*update*
I was working at my computer while listening to a podcast on these headphones. I had to use the restroom, I was able to walk all the way upstairs and listen to the podcast while doing business without any interruption! The distance on these things is ridiculous!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I'll start by saying I had a hard time finding genuine Beats online, if you search online you quickly learn what to look for. These were a bit less than retail, so I wondered if I'd be getting an authentic pair. It was indeed authentic (Mickey's 90th Anniversary Solo3 Beats).

The headphones are gorgeous, they make me smile. The sound is definitely fantastic. I had heard mixed comments on the Beats sound quality, but I spent this morning switching between the Beats Solo 3 and Bose QC35 and I honestly prefer the Beats sound quality. Of course, the QC 35 have perfect noise cancellation, but the Beats never claim to be noise-cancelling.

My only complain about the Solo 3 is that they are on-ear as opposed to over the ear. This means the cushions rest directly on top of your ears and I found that they became a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours of continuous use. I don't know if I'll get used to it, or the cushions will soften/adapt more to my ears. But for prolonged listening, right now, I would prefer an over-the-ear pair.

I'm overall happy with the purchase and I think most people will be too.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"As you can see I have a variety of different pairs and these are the best sounding, most comfortable pair I own. Synced easily with my iPhone, and work perfect with my Series 1 Apple Watch music controller. I wasn't worried about the sync being an issue. They are so comfy even with my 3/4 size gauges, with them being metal it doesn't push them into my neck like some headsets do. They don't slip around either. They cover my entire ear and make a nice ""seal"" I guess you could say. Literally if they are turned up even to half the max volume I can't hear anything around me. Definitely would recommend them to anyone. I got them when they were $179 had some gift cards and such so I got a great deal on them, Amazon definitely has the best prices on these keep and eye on it if you aren't looking to drop the $300.

"Love these headphones. Great sound and easy to connect. Battery life is also exceptional. After having to replace many cheaper brands after a few months, I decided to test out these. I have had them only a month so I cannot speak to longevity but will update if that is a problem. I did notice that, with the first two usages, my phone dropped the bluetooth connect after about one hour (mistakenly thought the battery died) but that has not since happened.",5.0 out of 5 stars

UPDATE- My Beats broke within a couple months internally when I just unfolded them like normal and one side doenst produce sound. I am very dissapointed because I love these things, but for $300 and they break within a year and cost half the price to repair, I reccomend to get a pair of B&o's or Bose headphone cause the sound quality is way better. If you just follow mainstream in tech, youll probably considering getting a pair of these, but they are only ok sound quality for $300 and are like getting Supreme, you get it because it has that ""b"" and ""Beats"" on it.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Obsessed!! After paying full price for these as a gift for my spouse last holiday season and listening to him brag about how awesome they were, i saw the same beats solo3 on sale during prime day. These live up to the hype, especially for less than $150! I’d been using a cheaper (yet prettier) set of over the ear headphones but they would start to feel tight after a bit, didn’t have wireless/Bluetooth option, and the sound was tinny. Now i totally get the big deal about these! They’re light weight, simple to use, the sound is AMAZING, they blocked out ambient noise like a BOSS, and are so so comfortable. Feels like pillows on your ears. Highly recommend. My hubby has used them almost daily to work out in (read: sweat like crazy) and for travel and they last!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Munson bought with his money this headphones. I have use them to test, the sound is pretty good but I don’t like the fit, they feel too tight on my head and the ear caps feel to little. They are not the big ear cover like other ones I’ve seen. I guess they are different styles I’m just saying I like the bigger ones that cover your entire ear.
I couldn’t wear it for more than 15 minutes because of the pressure on my head.
If I compare it to my BOSE I love my Bose thousand times more.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I have had these headphones for about a year. I love them. However, the leather is coming off the head phones after a little over 12 months. Hard to justify a $300 purchase when they fall apart. After googling the issue it seems like a common issue. I contacted apple and they will not do anything to help me other than offer me a replacement for $150. If that is the case, I would rather buy another brand that will hold up. It is great the sound quality and battery life is fantastic, but if they are falling apart like this, how am I supposed to use them. Seems like a bad design. I suggest googling the issue before you buy.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros
Amazing 40-hour battery life
Good, clear sound on iphone7 from all audio sources (music & other audio playback apps such as YouTube)
Decent call quality for user and caller (unsure of performance in noisy backgrounds or windy conditions)
Good volume range for audio playback and phone calls
Decent noise canceling ability without integration of electronic noise canceling technology (I think ear cups are manually designed for optimum noise canceling)
Cord with high-quality mic provided with headset
USB charging fcable included (able to use iPhone wall charger or other compatible USB wall charger to charge headset as well as charging from connection to PC)
Only 2 hours charging time for full battery life
Comfortable ear cup padding
Headset controls not flimsy and easy to operate
Unbroken long-range Bluetooth connectivity using iphone7
Steller support for software updates, Bluetooth connectivity, and support questions (Beats products are owned and supported by Apple company)
Easy setup and installation with iphone7 (unsure of performance with Mac or Windows PC)

Cons
Some notable trouble using headset to answer mobile calls as well as soft phone calls (skype, what's app, etc.)
Very tight fit (tight squeeze on head causing frequent headaches, though diminished a slight bit after frequent use)
No voice feedback when operating controls (battery life can only be determined by viewing indicator LEDS; troublesome for blind user)
Strangely, no headset battery indicator on iphone7 status bar (many other bluetooth headsets show battery status next to Bluetooth indicator on iPhone status bar)

Well, as you can see, I've experienced a mixed bag of positive and negatives in using this headset. Here are some additional observations based on my experience.

* Though I'm not an experienced audiofile, the bass seems full without distorting other sounds. I experienced enjoyable audio quality when watching TV apps, youtube videos, and listening to music.
* My main purpose for trying this headset was for phone call quality by comparing them with the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series. I did experience fairly clear feedback from callers when using the headset, but callers sometimes reported a bit of distortion from my end but it was only slight. Additionally, I had frequent occurrences where, after receiving a call, I could not answer with the headset when trying to use them to answer the call. Instead, the call was routed to the iPhone itself and I had to manually route the call to the headset.

An Interesting Experience to Note

However, the strangest anomaly occurred when using this headset. From reading reviews and talking with Apple support, I was told, definitively, that this headset does not have a built-in mic when being used wirelessly (accompanying cord does have built-in mic). However, I successfully used the headset using Bluetooth connection (not with cord) and callers could hear me with no trouble. So, I reasoned that if this Beats headset doesn't have a built-in mic, then my iphone7's mic is being used to communicate with callers. However, after moving over 100ft. from my iPhone, the callers could hear me as clearly as when I was less than 5ft. away from the iPhone. So, I really don't know how my voice is being transmitted to callers when I'm communicating wirelessly with this headset. hmmm!

* In addition to trouble in answering calls with this headset, my main beef with this Beats product is the really tight squeeze on my head. Unfortunately, this tightness was quite uncomfortable to the point where I dealt with several headaches. Though I've only had these for 3 weeks, the discomfort has only diminished slightly.

Frankly, because I find the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series to have superior call quality on both ends and to be much more comfortable than these, I will most likely return this headset though it consists of many good features such as seamless connectivity with the iPhone and amazingly high battery life.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"We got these on Black Friday which made them an excellent value. Overall, these headphones are very comfortable and above average from a sound quality standpoint. There are many cheaper options out there, many of which I have tried, but I think that these are really a step up.

My first pair lasted less than a year before they started giving problems. Battery life started decreasing. Then the led on/off light wouldn't turn off so it began draining the battery. So sent it in to be repaired thru warranty company. Well they sent it back in worse condition. Headphones went dead after 3 days and would not recharge. I also found damage on the right earpiece that looks like it was preyed open with a flat head screwdriver. So I informed warranty company again and then called amazon. The rep from amazon was really cool. Said not to worry we are sending you a brand new pair instead. Love how amazon takes care of the problem better than aftermarket warranty company.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased the Beats for my daughter and she loves them. This is the second set of Solo3's I've purchased for her. The left speaker failed on each pair. I've done research on the internet and learned that Beats has a problem with the left speaker failing due to a small wire being pinched during production. Unknown if this is the problem with the Beats I've purchased. The second pair I sent back for repair and am still waiting for them to be returned. Apple/Beats needs to address this problem immediately. Amazon has been great with their fast response to assisting us with sending them back for repair, however we were told ten days. It's been longer than that. Thanks",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are...petite, I guess would describe it. They're on-ear, and even when extended fully the headband clamps them on to your head with a tenacity worthy of something from the first Alien movie. My ears can't take more than about 20 minutes before the aching and lack of blood circulation force me to take them off. Haven't encountered this with other on-ear headphones before - the first step in using headphones is actually leaving them on your head, and when that's not really possible, all other considerations pale in significance.

That said, the sound quality is OK, but not great. These sound better than previous Beats headphones, so Beats is definitely improving, but for the price, there are better sounding headphones. These headphones don't overemphasize bass as much as older Beats headphones did, but it's still a bass-heavy headphone. If you want to hear treble and mid-range, there are cheaper headphones that will deliver them more effectively.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a replacement my cheap $25 bluetooth headphones. What a world of difference. Every genre of music sounds fantastic. They are a bit heavy but you get used to the weight. The controls are on the side of the headphones and are easy to use. They pair very easily with Apple products and even with Android products. I found there was a bit of delay with the signal for Kindle HD 10 but I had that same problem with my old headphones. However, the trouble didn't last long. I wore the headphones on a long 2 mile walk and although my ears got warm they did not sweat profusely. I wouldn't use them for a hard workout though. I wish the ear cups were a bit bigger because while I was walking there was a bit of pressure on my ears. They are great for sitting at home and even some light housework. The range is decent but the signal will start to break up around 500 feet away. I would recommend an arm band for your phone or mp3 device if you would like to walk around the house with them and still have good signal. They reduce a lot of exterior noise so they could be good on an airplane or library.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Purchased these head phones under 2 years ago. They are in great condition. Very little use of the past 2 years. They stopped taking a charge months ago. Finally got around to contacting Apple support about the issue. The one year limited warranty did help Apple would not replace the defective Beats Solo headset. Very disappointed with their service and not willing to stand behind their products. Recently my son had a issue with wireless Bose headset. The covering came off due to wear. They too were about 2 years old and out of warranty. Bose support send him a shipping label and replaced the headset free of charge. I'm a Bose customer for life.

"I’m primarily comparing the beats I own to DNA monster headphones I purchased at sharper image. DNA put the beats to shame in sound quality, the quality of materials is equivalent, whereas the beats win in terms of battery.

Here is the problem; why in the world would beats be so popular if their sound quality lacks severely? My answer: Dre, and the fact that they are just cool and come in rose gold (in my case). The battery typically does last a Day, which I gotta say I love. The fact that they auto pair nicely with my phone is great too. I would recommend over-ear beats if you just have to spend the money tho, on ears do get uncomfortable. If I could do it over again, I would have lefts these overpriced headphones on the shelf.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"They are so tight on my head I an unable to wear or use them -- they pinch and give a terrible headache. Also, if you wear them to workout or even walk, everystep reverberates into the ears. They are awful and they won't let me return.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I’ll get to the point.

Pros:

- Noise cancellation is superb. Nothing should disturb your music sessions with these on.

- Bass is adequate. Not earth shattering but good enough for a former bass head who had 10 inch subwoofers in my old Acura :-)

- Battery life is great. Didn’t have to charge these things for days.

CONS:

- Decibels could be louder. I tried these at max volume on all of my devices and was disappointed. Max volume should have your ears ringing but not the case here.

- mid range cords and vocals are lacking.

- The case requires effort to get the headphones inside. It should be effortless.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I have no complaints! Came in original box with everything as described. I’m not a headphone connoisseur and haven’t owned any others comparable to these so I can’t speak to how they measure up to others. I had been told they were of good quality so I got them, and I have enjoyed them so far. Easy to set up, and the charge lasts a long while. If you wear them for hours on end, your ears do get kind of sore, but i would expect that for any type of headphone like this. Does a pretty good job blocking out surrounding noise. We shall see if they stand up against the test of time and are worth the cost.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these for my daughters birthday. I gave them to her yesterday. I ordered them on Amazon Prime day so the window for returning was August 18th. I assumed ( hoped) they would work directly out of the box. My daughter was so excited to get these and they don't work! One side of the headphones is silent. I am SO DISAPPOINTED and am wondering if perhaps they sent out faulty ones on Amazon Prime Day? I did not buy the warranty because I assumed these were high quality headphones that would work if taken care of. I guess I learned my lesson about buying something and holding onto it for a gift at a later date. :-(,1.0 out of 5 stars
I have 2 pair of these and both stopped working via bluetooth after about a year. If you google beats stop working in 1 ear you will see all kinds of reviews. Beats is part of Apple so the support is the worst. I would not waste your money. For the price these should last many many years.,1.0 out of 5 stars
I have had two of these. One I bought from Apple and the other was from Amazon. I tried the The Amazon one because it was about $100 less and will not hold the charge when turned off. No support from Amazon or Beats. Disappointing.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I had this unit for more than a month before returning it. Right off the bat, I didn’t like the controls being on the left side. Most people are right handed. Why put the controls on the left? Not only that but the functional layout of the controls were a little confusing. The power button (located on the right, go figure) was so tiny. I couldn’t locate the stupid thing after I had already put the headphones on. I felt like I was reading braille. I could not adjust it comfortably on my head, especially in the gym, in a good position w/o it falling every so often. I’d like to think I have a normal size head. On the plus side, the range (at least 60 ft.) and battery life (with 2/3 hrs of use per day could last a week w/o charging) was excellent. Oh, I liked the red/black combination of colors.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Finally decided it was time to throw away my old head phones since they were basically being held together by tape. Caught these on sale during amazon prime day. The wireless solo's are great for the gym. I don't have to worry about the cord getting in the way during my workouts and I can go days without having to recharge the battery. The sound quality is great, legit cant hear anything but music when I'm wearing them. My only issue is sometimes the connection isn't clear when I'm running (probably because I'm moving).",5.0 out of 5 stars
"As a music lover, I could not wait to purchase my first pair of Beats. Getting the most out of music has always been a big thing for me. After saving up for months, I was finally able to purchase a pair of the Beats Solo3, only to find that after a short three months, the wrapping around the earpieces had begun to detach. After paying $230+ for these earphones, I was severely disappointed on the quality. If you do decide sink this much money into these, make sure to get a warranty.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Received these today. Genuine, brand new product in factory packaging. I had the solo2 for a long time and have been pretty rough on them, gym sweat finally killed them. So I’ve read many reviews and have owned several pairs and have come to a few conclusions. They have probably the best sound of any headphones I’ve tried, they are pretty tough and I’ve used the Apple warranty before for a broken set, they just sent me a new pair. With my past experience and what I put these through I decided to buy the 2 year extended warranty for $24, total purchase was $179.
I don’t think you’ll find a better deal anywhere on these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"These headphones, like other beats products, have great quality not just in sound, but the design and everything that comes with it. The headphones are amazing to tune out from your surroundings and just jam out to whatever you like and not worry about missing a call or taking out your phone to adjust the volume or pausing your music or video. Everything is there on the left side phone to make your life easier. My only problem with these headphones is the On the ear design, Your better off getting Studio 3's if you're looking for comfortability while wearing these. Over long periods of time they start to hurt your ear and for instance, let's say you are laying in bed, u can't necessarily wear them while laying on your side, the only position u can wear them in bed is to face up. either way, these headphones are good, the only downside is to how long you can endure their uncomfortability that's all.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"overall, if i could go back and not buy this, i would. this is more of a brand type head set, i don't believe it's worth what you're getting. i've been told you can get some for 150 that sound better than this, and i'm looking into it myself. i feel cool walking around with this expensive head set, and i suppose it's not horrible, but as for someone who is not blessed with money, i would say don't waste your money if you're expecting $250 quality, i would say these are worth about 150 instead. battery life is amazing, a 5 minute charge can last me hours, and i can listen an entire week for several hours on a full charge with out needing to charge again. i give these a 3 because there is good qualities, but the price is just a deal breaker for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I wish it were possible to give lower than one star. Ordered one day delivery and they came in 2 days late. But,when they came they were white when I ordered black. No original packaging, they were dirty, and the bluetooth said Sam's beats. I complained to customer service. So they sent me another pair which worked great for one day. Bluetooth function failed. I only bought these bc my beats studio quit working beyond their hard reset. But, all beats are junk. Would never recommend to even my worst enemy or the annoying kids in xbox live.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I’ve been rocking old school wired Bose QC’s for years (and never write product reviews). As a frequent traveler I rely heavily on my Bose Noise Cancelling “capabilities” - not something these Beats really have. That said, I paid $130 for this lil set-up on Prime Day - fantastic deal. A “whole” day into wearing them and I’ve got to say it just may have been the best $130 I’ve ever spent (heck, they could fall apart tomorrow for all I know). First, I’m really kicking myself in the butt for not going wireless sooner - I’m always snagging the wires on something and popping the wire plum out). Wireless is so liberating!!! The range on these things is incredible. I’ve got a pretty big house and I haven't found a reasonable area where the signal poops out (w/o curling up in a closet upstairs w/ my ipad in the garage). Second, the sound - crisp, clear and plenty loud. I’ve not taken them off since getting them - No doubt that’s going to agitate my wife:). Admittedly I’ve always been a Bose fanboy (not an audiophile though) and dismissed Beats all together as “just another shiny object w/ a great marketing angle”. My kids of course only wear Beats and tell me how much of an old man I look like with my wired Bose phones. Finally, battery life “if as advertised”. I’ve got about 12 hours on these guys so far which already impresses me:). The only “Cons” (it applies to most on-ear phones) are Noise in - they're not Noise Cancelling nor are they advertised to be / and Noise out - I’ve been listening to these things a fair bit louder than I do with my other headphones - when I take them off I notice how loud they are potentially to those around me (going to need to keep the volume at a reasonable setting I suppose). These things rock though - I keep finding myself dancing around the house and I’m no dancer. Get a pair, you wont regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Used them for couple months. They died like 4 months ago. Won’t charge, won’t turn on, only one side works when using aux cable. During the the time they did work they were great. Came in original beats packaging. Everything included. Got them during a daily deal so it was a great price. These are my second pair of beats. First were mixrs from Best Buy so I know they’re the same beats value. BUT After multiple cables I contacted Apple. Was thankfully still under warranty. Currently shipping for repair. Hoping it’s covered. I was skeptical about buying something like this on amazon. But if it’s a factory issue I would defiantly change my rating to a 5 because as of now I’m not sure what the issue is. I have read that solo 3s do have a lot of issues. Hoping for the best.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I've gone through a handful of over the ear headphone throughout the ears, always trying to save a few bucks. I finally splurged on these babies and it's my greatest purchase of 2019. My main use is for traveling, I can't ever sleep on planes or in airports and with these little monsters, I'm sound asleep in minutes. Half the time, I don't even put on music, I just ""activate"" the super power of noise cancelling and it's like magic. I do use them while at work and even after I've had them on for hours, they're still comfortable. For conference calls, I've noticed that the quality of input sound is much better than my airpods and I have never had any clients complain that I'm hard to hear. FIVE THUMBS and A MILLION STARS!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is fabulous. I purchased these for my husband after he kept taking mine! The most impressive feature is that they work great on your phone. I talk to clients using my beats each day and they work perfectly. Clients comment on how well they can hear me AND I can hear them crystal clear. Not only that but they are extremely comfortable whether using at the gym or for work.

Had for short time and barely used went to place on my head and plastic arm cracked. Placed back into case until returning home from trip and contacted amazon who nicely said since it was 2 days out of return period apple would warranty and nicely put me through to apple. Apple had me send back but said it was physical damage and would not cover (via a note in the return box without even contacting me). Contacted amazon again as they had requested if apple didnt help. Only response was to put me back through to apple who couldn't tell me the cost to repair and diagnosis could be 100 dollar fee(according to the note).,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Arrived when expected, arrived as expected. I'm a repeat buyer, this is my second pair of BEATS Solo3 headphones (the other one is still fine, I just keep one set in my home, and the other is for when I'm mobile/outdoors). The sound from these headphones is GREAT! They fit well and are comfortable. They're easy to connect to various devices (I've used them w/Samsung smart TV, iphones and ipad). They hold their charge for long periods and are easy to use (power button, adjust sound volume, mute button etc.). Highly recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sounds is good but the headphones are super tight on my ears. Makes my ears hurt after wearing them to long. I should have bought the over ear version. They don’t cancel noise. The phone microphone is super sensitive and doesn’t cancel out outside noise. They are good for short use. Good sound and connect easily to my iPhone. I think Apple could have done a better job implementing more technology and comfort to these headphones. But then again they haven’t perfected the iPods, which I love but they need to fit in my ear better.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Bought this product twice. Once in 2017 and again in 2019. The first pair fell started falling apart after 3 months (headphone material). The second pair lasted a few days over the 1 year mark and although this time they didn’t fall apart the power LED won’t shut off.

I tried all the different methods on their site and what others suggested doing, but nothing worked. I contacted beats support and they said I was out of the limited service warranty period so I would need to pay $129 to have them fixed or replaced.

I bought my first pair at $200+ and the second pair at $150 and now they want another $129 to fix a problem that seems to be an ongoing issue with their product due to poor construction. Aside from that, they sound good, which is why I feel inclined to give 2 stars, but based on my experience with these headphones that’s as much as I’m willing to rate it due to poor construction and warranty services.

If you’re going to buys these make sure to get an extended warranty or purchase them at Apple with AppleCare.",2.0 out of 5 stars
My son got these for his birthday. He loves them so much! He always has them on his head and loves the wireless feature. He can have his phone at one end of the house and go all the way to the other end of the house and it is still connected. He had an issue setting it up. You hit the button for 1 second for apple phones and 5 for android. The battery last a long time. He normally charges it at night but it last all day and isn't dead at night when he goes to charge it. The sound is incredible and it is so soft and light weight on the ears and head. I would defiantly recommend these to anyone or any age that loves listening to music or watching movies on tablets/phones.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The reason why I'm giving 3 stars is because the Apple support is great and they are arranging to give me a repaired unit soon, the sound quality is really good as well, and the battery life is crazy long.
I have used these headphone really not even 6 months of regular usage, I have not really over used them, I mainly had them on the pouch, but still, in less than a year they ended up looking like in the pictures below.
I am not sure at this point if this was faulty unit from the manufacturer or who knows what.
I never dropped the headphones, never use them while on the gym, to be in contact with water, but still.
The product on the sound aspect, has an amazing texture of base, lows, it really makes you immerse on the sound itself, I just wish this wouldn't happen. Hope this helps, as many other experiences might not be the same as mine.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I generally like Beats headsets. The sound quality is great and they are elegantly constructed. This is the second Beats product I bought. The first one (Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphone) broke at the hinge after two years of daily, but careful use.

I was told to call the 800 number for Beats, and they were not helpful either. They will not replace since the headphones are only 5 months past warranty.

What a waste of money. Its like they almost know in advance that you'll be stupid enough to hide these away long enough that the super short 30 day return period passes. And don't bother calling about how they don't work. They will just tell you that they can't help you or to call the manufacturer. Likely as not these are second rate and thus the deal.

"Everyone. Please do not buy any product from Beats. All beats products are made from China from really cheap materials and other things in the making of the product. So they are sold here in the U.S for an exaggerated high amount price, and it’s a big profit for the Beats company. Don’t fall into just the brand and it’s marketing strategies. Would you rather look for well-known brand or for quality headphones, proven to work and perform outstandingly? And these other outstanding products are even cheaper than Beats. Why, because the price for Beats is an unreasonable price. The Beats are not worth that price because it’s made with cheap materials. Always research first and read reviews.

Apple just lost another fan. If they can't stand behind their products or at least build something that works longer than 4 months, they are no better than their Chinese Knock-offs.

These are the best sounding pair of headphones I’ve ever owned, and the decision to purchase was not taken lightly because of the cost. Sound quality is amazing. I’m hearing lyrics I’ve never heard before.

The ONLY downside to these is comfort. They’re fine if I’m wearing them for only an hour at a time, but any longer than that and my ears start to hurt because of the pressure. It almost makes me want to consider saving up for a pair of over-the-ear Studios.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I take care of all the electronics I own. I've gone through maybe ten or fifteen pairs of earbuds so far. These beats aren't those earbuds, and they aren't like many headsets

This is a stupidly comfortable over ear headset with the sound and design to match its Apple product cost. It has lasted me seven months without any sign of trouble. It is sturdy, easily collapsible, and a fast charge for the one or two week charge you could get out of it, even with playing music everyday. Its bluetooth connection is crystal clear and easy to configure most of the time.

However, I am a six foot adult male with a big head. I should've gone with the Beats Studio 3 since its a much larger design for a little bit more money. I don't even remember how I broke the bands on the sided of the headset, though I'm keeping them together via tape. The cost to repair the headset IN APPLE STORE STYLE costs as much as the headset, which is ridiculous. Thankfully, my beats are still fully functioning, and I plan on buying another headset when I have the money.",4.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are great if you can get them to connect to your iPhone. It takes about 15-30 minutes every time you want to get them to connect to your Bluetooth. I’ve tried everything. My headphones power button will be flashing and my iPhone will be searching and nothing happens. You just have to keep powering off the headphones and turn them back on to flashing or keep shutting your phone off and turning it back on.

"I purchased these to finally go wireless with less ports on my work machine than before and I got to use these for about 6 months before they stopped charging completely, rendering them useless as wireless headphones.

They’re very pretty, and the folding aspect with the case is clever. The wire for using them as wired is nice but, if I wanted wired headphones I wouldn’t have paid an extra $100 for these.

Additionally, it’s worth noting that you should be aware of the size of your head. I wear glasses and found these very uncomfortable to wear after an hour or two because they pushed the arms of the glasses into the sides of my head. I could get around it by pushing the arms of my glasses over the ear cushion but this obviously messed with my astigmatism prescription.

The charging problem is not a one-off thing. Do a web search and see that many people have needed to fix this and it involves cutting open the headphone to rewrite it yourself.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these because they were on sale for $140 that day. That’s a decent price for them. I wouldn’t pay much more though. They are a little tight and pinch my ears after awhile—my head is not huge.

"I will admit I am a long-time review lurker, but never actually post reviews here because I'm lazy. However, I felt as if I should give an honest review for these, as the holiday season is approaching.

I'm a HUGE music guy and have had a pair of Beats and every On-Ear model since they first rolled out. My Solo 2 wired in headphones got stolen out of my luggage and I recently got the iPhone 8, so I figured it was finally time to venture into the ""Wireless"" territory. I purchased the Solo 3 Wireless Gloss Black pair back at the end of September and everything came as expected and they looked awesome.

However, after 45 min at the gym and them being fully charged, they just turned off and would not power back on. I tried numerous Youtube videos of resetting them and charging them, but nothing. I chatted with an Apple associate and ended up bringing them in to the Genius Bar and even they were baffled at what was going on. I sent them in for repair and got them back a few days later and after one use the same issue occurred.

I then went to the Apple store again and we looked at everything, software on my phone, the headphones, etc, and they were still baffled. I sent them in again and they sent me a new pair. This new pair worked well, but would not power off (light always flashing) and also would not charge at all. Maybe it was just the Gloss Black style? I don't know.

Finally, after about a month of frustration, I sent them back to Amazon and searched forever on Amazon for a new pair of great wireless headphones (since I used gift cards to buy this), but could not find anything that had the fashion, fit and sound that I liked from my Beats.

As a loyal Beats fan, I insanely purchased a new pair of the regular Black Solo 3 Wirless beats and so far everything has been working amazingly, the sound is awesome, the battery life is insane and they fit perfectly for when I'm going running.

Moral of the story is these headphones are really great, but like they always say, ""third time was a charm"" and the whole process of getting there was a bit frustrating. Therefore, I caution on the side of buying any warranty on these, as all of my costs were taken care of and I didn't spend a penny extra.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm a headphone enthusiast and I love these headphones. I have Sennheiser 600HD's, amped, in ear monitors, in ear Bose headphones, and about 4 other cans.

I would say these are ""Fun"". They don't have a huge sound stage, but you can't expect a huge soundstage from on ear headphones. They sound great for Bluetooth headphones and they feel comfortable.

I originally bought these for use in the gym since I workout 6-7 days a week but honestly I sweat way too much and these only make it worse. If you're a sweater then don't get these on ear headphones, you'll be miserable, you'd probably be better off with the in ear power beats.

I give these 5 stars though because they just sound fantastic. And they have a 40 hour battery life. That's just wild to me. They are the best (or should I say the funnest?) Bluetooth headphones I've tried out so far and I tried out quite a few before buying these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Alright to my review, bass: bass is alright I’d say, enough to satisfy me, not to much not to less, I will be honest when this is at max volume, it will shake your head hard, but if you can’t handle that volume I do not recommend. Sound quality: this is what I love about them the most, their sound quality is litteraly crystal clear. absolutely recommended if you just want to hear every detail of the music and video that you are watching. Comfort: the insides are made of memory foam which is really soft when worn in warm temperatures, which is really good, the top part has padding. but when in a cold temperature it gets really hard and uncomfortable, so if your looking for headphones for a cold climate, I do not recommend these, I have a couple of friends who absolutely destroyed their headphones, like torn the leather from the headphones, but to prevent that, keep it in a case at all times you are not using it, don’t leave it on the floor, on a desk, basically anywhere without its case(provided). Noise cancellation: their is some to no noise cancellation on these headphones, so if your in a loud environment your going to hear it. Noise leakage: I have tested these in a quiet environment and no one will here you, ok if it is at like max they can here it but it’s like a whisper(friend told me). So if your looking to listen to this in like a library, these absolutely for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones were a splurge for me but turned out to be an expensive disappointment. Wireless solo3 right side stopped working after warranty expired. Took great care in keeping these headphones pristine and even bought an additional matching case. Fees to repair start at $130 with $7 shipping just to look at them. Waste of money and won’t be replacing them with Beats. I can buy better ones from other companies for less than the cost to repair or replace.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I reeeeeally wanted to like this. I have another brand already and heard my sister's Beat. I decided to get myself one. The sound quality does not justify the price. It is not far from the $37.00 wireless unit I have, but fine I was going to keep it anyways. Then the biggest obstacle was the functionality. On my headphones, I can easily maneuver back, forth and sound up and down. The Beats did not seem to have the feature. Nothing other than power on and off. I am rather computer savvy but could not make it work. Back to the MPOW unit. It functions better for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First off the connectivity of these is great. I was two floors above my phone and they performed like normal! I am an Apple user so that might be why it's so good. These are super comfortable and they fit my head super well! The battery life is no joke too, I charged them too 93 percent used them the entire day checked the battery and there was still 87 percent left! Once you put these on at about 5 or 6 volume everything else fades out. The controls on these are also super helpful. You can adjust the volume, activate Siri, pause songs (works with Spotify) and pick up and hang up calls, I mean what else could you want. These look super sleek on your head. I recommend the matte black because then they don't take fingerprints and scratches easily. One other thing is the mic. It might just be me but there is a slight echo so you can hear what you are saying. Everyone that I've called says that I sound great! In conclusion, these are a great pair of headphones and they are totally worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These stopped working on one side; the leather started coming off! We
Sent them to Apple to fix; they accused us of third party tampering which did NOT happen and they sent them back in worse condition then they were when we sent them and now they are completely unusable. The warranty needs to be honored! It has not even been a year!",1.0 out of 5 stars
My wife uses these every time she goes to the gym - this is the first pair of expensive headphones that she is actually willing to use. Great battery life and works flawlessly with her iPhone. She is very pleased with the sound quality and it does a great job playing that hideous hip hop crap she listens to. Other reviews are luke-warm on this model but I can't agree with them - it's great value for money.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"it s the first time purchase an on-ear headphones so can not compare with other products. I have it for around 2 months now, sound quality is a bit above average, It has plenty of bass. like other Beats products, quality looks good. The battery life amazed me, 1 hour charge and I use it for 4-5 days, 10hrs/day. The range is pretty far, more than 50 yards I still have good connection. The only thing bothers me is that it hurts my ears after around 1 hour of using. I tried to stretch it by put it over a few book, then use hair dryer to heat it up, leave it over night. It helps quite a lot.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these for my hubby as a graduation present since the ones he had were the wired ones. Gave it to him for graduation and he originally didn't even use them for about a month. So, about 2 months after purchasing them the cover on the ear portion began to come apart. The thread just started to unthread and now you can see the cushion part of the ear. He doesn't even use them anymore. I am very disappointed as these headphones are not cheap and this was his graduation present for getting his Masters!",1.0 out of 5 stars
I got these for a trip and I still love them. They work very well and match my phone. They have a case so I can keep the cord and charger all together. They are adjustable and easy to set up. Noise quality is really great. These are not noise canceling ones but they block out noise well. They turn off in MN cold if you do Bluetooth but work just fine with the cord. There are many color options too.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The biggest quality these headphones have is by far how convenient they are and how easily they connect to an iPhone. They also look very good and the sound quality on these headphones is all right as long as you aren't expecting too much. The controls are also subtle and easy to reach.
However, I cannot recommend this product. The biggest problem with them is how fragile they are. After only six months of casual use, substantial damage is visible. Particularly on the headband, which lacks cushioning and tears very quickly. The other problem is the price. You can find headphones that accomplish the same job for about half the price when looking at brands like Sennheiser or AudioTechnica.
This product seems to be aimed at younger people looking for good looking and convenient headphones. I recommend that you save your money and look elsewhere for headphones that look just as good, sound just as good and are far cheaper.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Birthday present for my 15 year old, he absolutely loves them. I tried them myself and the sound quality is amazing. Couple of quick points:
1. do not have the audio cable plugged in when trying to turn on or setup Bluetooth. The cable needs to be left out in order to do that.
2. if you do use the audio cable, the 90 degree elbow end goes into the audio device and the straight end goes into the headphones. otherwise you will only get sound out of one side.
We had a couple issues initially, but that is only because we didn't follow the above two points. After figuring those out, the headphones work great. Great sound and decent comfort. Easy to setup.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I am constantly wearing headphones and wanted to switch it up by getting a pair of over the ear wireless headphones. I've been looking into getting Beats for a while and was excited to try these out!

1. I love the look of them! Thought I'd look hideous in over the ear wireless headphones but they're super cute and look great.

2. I love the optional cord to plug into devices (not the charger). Provides a nice option if you want to use that!

3. They're kind of comfy. Not the most comfortable I've ever experienced but decent. Maybe it adds to a little discomfort with the fact that I have multiple ear piercings that perhaps are a little smushed with these style of headphones.

4. The sound quality is AWESOME! So great.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"First off let me say that when they are not broken, they are excellent headphones. Sound quality, battery life, range, all of that is great. The problem is they are not durable at all. The first pair I owned, I had to send back to the manufacturer after 6 months due to the battery that all of a sudden stopped charging. It was under warranty so they were replaced. 9 months later the right headphone stopped working but because it was past their 1 year limited warranty (from purchase date) there wasn't anything I could do. I ended up giving them a second chance and buying a second pair, which lasted a little over a year until one side of the headphones (they are expandable) came clean off the headset. For $250 dollars I expect them to last longer than a year. I would suggest going with a different companies product unless you are comfortable replacing these every 12-18 months. All in all its been 28 months since I bought my first pair and now I need to buy a third set of headphones, it will not be from Beats.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Broke after a year. Nothing weird, just wouldn’t turn on one day. Sent them into apple for 130$ for service. After hours of dealing with the service department, they told me I “made product modifications” and they won’t fix them for the 130. These have never left the office. Essentially was accused of being some sort of bedroom hacker with my headphones? Stunningly ridiculous. They told me they’d fix them for $369. Not sure if they’re aware how much they are new? The whole experience is insulting, I won’t be buying more beats products.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I loved this product and gifted it to my wife for her birthday. Its been 5 months and she has barely used these. In the starting she mentioned that it gives her pain in the ear lobes, but i said may be she is not used to headphones so it takes time adjusting. Now she started back and has got a permanent pain in the lobes that hurts her in her day to day activities specifically sleeping as the ears touch he pillow. She has stopped using it now and this product is a waste for me. I want to return it back and need my refund but amazon will not entertain it now. It has created medical issues for my wife and the product is still almost new here. I invested money here and i m really really disappointed with the quality.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Full disclosure. I am an MPow guy that is very satisfied with the quality over my wireless headset. That said, I could not pass up on the deal during Amazon Prime Day. I got this headset for 55% off normal cost and have not been disappointed with my purchase. Very impressed by this headset. Mind you, I was the guy that would never spend $300+ on a pair of premium wireless headphones. At $146 you can't go wrong. ;)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these over three years ago and use mostly for travel and when I'm walking.
Had to take them to get replaced a little over a year ago because they stopped holding a charge and apple replaced when they could not repair. Well now the same thing is happening with the replacement. Couldn't get 2 years out of either head phone and since the one I have is a replacement no further warranty.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Really disappointed. When my wife first used these, running outdoors, they only lasted 5 minutes then shut down. She fully charged and tried again and once again, they stopped working after 5 minutes. Amazon replaced and the new pair is doing the same thing. I thought I was buying top-of-the-line equipment. By the way, the sound is good until they shut down. Honestly, I wouldn't buy these if you live up north where the outdoor temperature falls below 32 degrees.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Great product, until it stops working. 7 months use and no sound out of one side. Ear pads are also ripping away from frame and just look like material is crumbling.
Still under warranty, so we will see the fix they offer. Will update. At this point, not worth the price we paid, wouldn't buy again.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Shockingly poor quality materials and subpar construction for a premium priced product from Beats (and Apple). The sound is solid - although they should get louder in my opinion - but after just a handful of months of ""light use"" they are literally falling apart. There are two places where the adhesive has worn off and the components are separating from each other. Keep in mind, I'm not some punk kid who doesn't care for his stuff, I'm a 40-year-old man who absolutely babies my electronics!",1.0 out of 5 stars
The first Beats Solo3 received did not work. They would not go wireless nor would they fully work while plugged in. They had many issues. Amazon immediately sent a replacement as I packaged and sent the return item. The replacement head phones were as expected and worked great! My son has enjoyed hours of listening time in the few days he has had them. The battery is amazing and he loves the sound and feel of the headphones. A definite recommend.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I like this product very much. I have to say when I saw the packaging it made me realize how high the standards were. The unboxing experience was top notch and couldn’t ask for better. The first thing I notice when I put these headphones on was that the earmuffs were really soft and comfortable. Then I paired these up to my iPhone and I couldn’t even imagine the simplicity apple has created to pair these beats to a device. Next I played some music. It was very high quality and they were better than any of the headphones I’ve had before, the highs and lows were very balanced. And do not worry about these being counterfeit because I was worried when I purchased them but when I paired the beats there was proof of the W1 chip because of the simple pairing. The battery life on this is also remarkable I didn’t have to charge these for weeks till they were dead. Overall I really recommend picking these up, bye and I hope u like your beats. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these Beats headphones because they were on sale, and because I thought ""It's been a while since I had beats, maybe I should give them a second chance."" I should not have. I may be biased since I own high quality headphones, I have Bose QuietComfort 35ii and Sony WH-1000XM3s. I was expecting sound quality maybe just slightly below these with no active noise canceling since they were just on-ear and what I got was far below my expectations.

Sound Quality: 2/5
By no means are these the worse headphones I've ever listened to, but they are the worst headphones I have ever listened to at this price point. The trebles are just meh and that's the best part of these headphones. The mids sound like you're listening to someone else's party down the street or you're listening to someone else's music through a wall. It's atrociously bad and this is the worst part of the headphone. The bass is actually okay... until you have both bass and another range of sound playing at the same time. The bass quality is nice, and these really boost bass but you sacrifice washing out the rest of the song into a muddle mess and hearing nothing but slapping bass. This is fine, if you're a basshead and these headphones are GREAT when I'm listening to a bass-heavy rap song or EDM, but when I want to listen to anything else they're pretty trash.

Appearance: 3/5
These are beats and they look more like a fashion statement than any real headphones. Audiophiles will smirk as you pass by them because they know you paid way more than these are actually worth.

Comfort: 1/5
The clamping force is too hard for anyone to wear comfortably especially compared to what else is on the market for this price point. On top of that the materials used are super uncomfortable. The rubber headband pulls on your hair (and mine's short, I'm in the Marine Corps), the ear cups are stiff and made of some type of pleather probably, and after a half hour of wearing them (ONLY A HALF HOUR!!) I don't want to continue listening to these headphones since they push on my ears uncomfortably, grip my head and pull my hair (I'm not that into BDSM, thank you).

Ease of Access (iOS): 3/5
Ease of Access (everything else): 1/5

Connecting to an iPhone or iPad is a breeze, just turn the headphones on and bam you're connected for the most part. Sometimes it's a little finnicky. In comparison, the airpods have a much smaller form factor, better latency and better range.

Connecting to any other device is like trying to fight your mom; you'll probably win, but is it worth it? Definitely not. These will connect to your other devices, but in order to stop it from connecting to my iPad even when I had told my iPad to forget these headphones I had to take my iPad to another room and turn on these headphones outside with the device I wanted. Definitely cumbersome.

For full price of $299.99 these are just not worth it. Even for the discounted price of $160, they just aren't worth it.
Amazon has plenty of other well-priced headphones on the market...

For bassheads: Skullcandy Crusher Wireless ($120)
For flat EQ but good sound: Bose QuietComfort 35ii ($350)
For the best acoustic sound: Sony WH-1000XM3 ($350)
Best sound on a budget: Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (on sale for $130, but usually $150)

In summary, if you want convenient iOS headphones, just buy the airpods. If this is you're first time venturing into the expensive headphone market, I hope this review helped you move away from these headphones. I really don't know who these are for except people who were previously fans of the Beats line. If anything though, I think their sound quality has further degraded from when Beats was partnered with monster headphones. I hope this review helped!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are AWESOME! As a Mom, I am typically not a “name brand” kind of person. These were a gift from my husband and really a splurge, but I absolutely love them. Doing laundry, dishes, and other housework is much more enjoyable listening to music and these do not fall off my head like other headphones and earbuds I have owned in the past. So any Moms out there who aren’t sure about these, just go ahead and make the purchase. High quality, easy to connect, and well worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"love my headphones and if it gets soiled, I use a wipe or a damp soapy rag to clean it and it is a good as new. It cancels out everything and the battery life is as promised, I listened to my books when I’m cleaning the house, running errands, and doing choirs and I’m never worried that the battery is going to fail me.

"I like the sound quality, the lightness, and I’m pleasantly surprised by the comfort level. I have previously owned Beats Solo 2’s Wireless and they did hurt my ears after wearing them awhile.

I’d say these were a great purchase at 129 dollars during the recent Cyber Monday event.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are HORRIBLE! I have gotten 2 different pairs for my fiancé. Both pairs will not hold a charge. When they do charge, the die very quickly. Disconnect from phone for no reason. Cannot even get to turn on anymore when they are fully charged. These are a waste of money and should be fraud for what the represent compare to what they provide to you. Two different pairs have done the same thing. It's the product in general. bad quality. Do not waste your money on these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros:
1- looks amazing
2- Loud sound
3- fair bass

Cons:
1- No Next/Previous track buttons.
2- Ears get too hot at gym because of the leather. I would really prefer if they made another sport line that contains cushion instead.

Concentrate on the performance & comfort. The only difference between Solo 2 & 3 is battery which doesn’t make sense",3.0 out of 5 stars
If you are a bass hunter or like dubstep this is for you otherwise look for better quality headphones low range is non existent or muffled and medium is there but super heavy on bass and the wireless works well but not long range enough the earpads are the same from other models so they will ware out better to buy replacements now or higher quality ones. You are buying the name not good headphones. Decent battery life.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"My nephews wanted these, and they love them. They sound okay to me, but I'd honestly look elsewhere if you want a high-quality, comfortable pair of headphones.

The bluetooth and battery life are the real pluses on these. The battery lasts forever, they charge pretty quickly, and the bluetooth has a really good range. The sound tends to be a bit bass-heavy and possibly muddy, and I don't know how comfortable they would be over a long session. I tried them out only for a few minutes and could only go off of my immediate impressions.

Depending on your genre preferences, these may be suitable. For me, I would look elsewhere.",4.0 out of 5 stars

These headphones sound really good like other beats headphones I have had. The problem with these headphones is how uncomfortable they are. If you are only using them for 30 minutes or so they are just fine. Anything more than that your ears will start hurting more and more. I don't know why they went with on ear headphones pads instead of over ear headphones. The studio headphones I have are over ear and they can be worn for hours without any discomfort.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I really enjoy the convenience of these wireless headphones. They're easy to use and fit comfortably over my ears. They're not too heavy, which I was concerned about because I plan to run in them, and the collapsible arms are helpful for storage. In terms of sound quality, I don't feel that they're especially better than other good quality headphones, but they're good. The sound quality certainly isn't compromised at all. Whether intentional or not, they do have some noise cancellation effect also which I appreciate. Overall, pleased with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I just ordered and received these headphones today (same day delivery with Prime). I'll start by saying they are authentic Beats (Fulfilled by Amazon). I purchased the protection plan just in case. That being said, i'm listening to music with these headphones as I write this review, and they are perfect.

They'll be gym tested tomorrow, but based on the fit, I don't anticipate any issues. A great first impression.

My granddaughter loved them. She plays the piano and can hook them up to her keyboard and listen to songs as she plays them back on the piano without bothering the rest of her family.

I order the headphones thinking they would do me justice on my deployment in Kuwait but I was wrong like way wrong. The first month they were perfect in every aspect of the word but out of nowhere one side went out and would barely work since. Two more months passed and then they just stopped working all together and since the warranty was with a 3rd party it just left me with broken headphones in the middle of my deployment. I will never buy anything like this from amazon again and amazon was my trusted source till now. So be careful what you buy and trust and believe these are trash.,1.0 out of 5 stars
90 days after purchasing the material began to tear away from the head piece. I took it to the Apple store and they replaced them only to have it happen within 90 days again.

"Power button stopped working after a little over a year, which after some extensive googling seems to be a very common problem with beats headphones.

Sad to have lost them, which I guess indicates something in their favor. But angry enough not to want to buy them again.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"Was looking to upgrade from my original solo’s and I’m incredibly pleased with the Solo3’s. These headphones are so aesthetically pleasing! I got the Satin Silver color and I am so happy with how crisp they look. These are more comfortable than the original Solos and seem to be constructed in a more solid manner (I threw in a picture of my old white Solos for comparison, which might I add lasted me SEVEN years without trouble, hoping for the same longevity with the Solo3’s). The Solo3’s sound awesome and the pairing capabilities are lightining fast due to the w1 chip that allows for speedy pairing with Apple devices.

These headphones are really nice. The bass isn't too crazy but enough where it doesn't disort it. The sound overall is pretty decent. They connect easy and have impressive battery life.

I love the headphones in general but have found that after 30 minutes of use and they make my ears hurt. They push against my piercings into my cartilage to be quite sore. I have attempted to get replacement ear cushions in hopes of getting some a little bigger but if you change ear cushions then it voids warranty. They also do not offer replacement ear cushions from beats. So in my case they have not been worth the money I spent on them. I attempted to allow my 11 year old to use them and he states it hurts his ears also. Might be just us might be a issue for others as well. I would go with the studio headphones if you getting them over the ear.,3.0 out of 5 stars

I have had these headphones for almost 2 weeks now and I love them! They are able to connect to all of my devices via bluetooth with no issues and they hold a charge for a long time. I use them for hours on end and haven't had a problem with the battery getting low or dying on me. The sound is also great. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a bit tight on my ears and it starts to hurt after about an hours use. I ordered the gloss black which I feared may look cheap or leave fingerprint marks but it actually looks very nice in person and doesn't get dirty easily.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are awesome for working out in a crowded gym– noise cancelling enough to block out all the other machines without having to turn up my music to dangerously high volumes, big enough to signal “don’t talk to me”, and adjustable so they don’t fall off my head when I’m doing abs or something (a big problem for me, I have a tiny and weird shaped head). Plus, the matte black is very pretty (in my opinion). Plus, the automatic connection from the W1 chip to my iPhone is a MAJOR bonus over the older models; otherwise, I can’t tell much of a difference from my old Solo2s. If you don’t have an iPhone, maybe save your money and go for an older model, but if you do, then the W1 is an amazing investment. Overall, I love em!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Great color and was waiting to get these when I could afford it, but these are $110 less than I have seen elsewhere so became my birthday present to myself! Convenient with a carry case. I would have made the zipper on the carry case open wider, but that is my only complaint. Even has a carabiner to snap it on something for safe traveling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought as a gift and my husband LOVES them! He likes to listen to house music so the bass is a huge deal. He could not stop talking about how incredible they are. While not deafeningly loud to the wearer, people around can hear the music. So I wouldn't recommend wearing them at a high volume in a library or someplace where you need to be quiet. The sound quality is superb though.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Very very VERY disappointed! After less than 6 months of using them (and I bought two pairs!) both are:
- Having problems since day one to connect through Bluetooth
- Going away and coming back sound quality
- Need to be charged for over 24hrs to work for 2hrs straight
- Disconnecting in the middle of work online meetings and webinars
- Currently, both pairs are NOT WORKING!!!

I am utterly disappointed, upset and I would never EVER recommend this product! I have been THE BIGGEST FAN of Dr. Beats and the products over the years but this has been super disappointing, especially buying them for Christmas gifts and never dropping them or doing anything that would harm the product or sound....
I want the seller to contact me immediately!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Liked them, sound was good, but they crapped out. No power. No lights. Charge was good while it lasted. Bought a new battery, but it didn’t fix them.

Super expensive for headphones that only made it 2 years. And, I really babied them. I have other Bluetooth cans and speakers (JBL’s and Mpow’s) that are much less expensive that are still working great. Surprisingly great sound on the cheaper ones also.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"So, everything came great and it was good quality. I just got a headache from wearing them because it was too tight on my head and the pressure changed in my ears. If pressure and band size isn't an issue for you then this should work great but if you are prone to headaches the pressure of these headphones won't be for you.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm a huge Disney nut & wanted these soooo bad but didn't want to pay $300. So when they finally went on sale during Black Friday deals, I was super excited!! At first they great & then after about an hour, they became really uncomfortable on my ears. It felt as though they were clamping my ears down to my head like a vice grip. I tried adjusting them, taking out my earrings or just moving them around in general. The only thing that helped was taking them off. I was so disappointed and had no choice but to return them. They were no good to me if I couldn't wear them for more than an hour at a time.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Battery power is phenomenal.
Two weeks without charging. Everyday use. The only down fall is the case in which the headphones come. It is so small and won’t protect headphones but that can be easily replaced by buying a bigger/hard case which there’s a lot to choose from here at amazon. Worth the price for the quality and duration of battery!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is my second pair of Beats Headphones my first wireless version. They are perfect!! I fly all over the US almost every week. They connect to my ipad and phone effortlessly. The sound is rich and you can hear everything. Even thought they are not touted as ""noise cancelling headphones"" I find that they do a very good job at keeping the airplane noises to a minimum. I recommend these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Can’t say enough about the battery life. Bought them for my 12 year old who consistently is hooked up to wired headphones. He uses them for hours during the day and hasn’t had to charge them in 3 weeks. They still have 53% battery life left. Specifications say 70hr battery life but I really didn’t expect it. Only downfall is, the case provided with them is a soft case and not very protective so I would definitely consider spending an additional $10 on a hard case for them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Everything was great—worked just as described, looks good, excellent sound quality and very comfortable.....and then if got cold. Not crazy cold—it’s just 25F —just below freezing. They just shut off. Very sad as I planned to use them for winter hikes and cross country skiing....I would give it a 5 star rating if I lived where it was warmer all year.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Beats Solo3 Wireless do not disappoint at any aspect. Great sound, long battery life, easy to use, very comfortable, looks awesome. We are price sensitive buyers and we would like to get our money's worth. These headphones are a good value-for-money purchase. We gave this as a gift to our son and he loves it! It's really hard to get these out of his hands and I ""borrow"" them whenever I get a chance. I am looking at getting a pair for myself, too.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"My biggest complaint is that for an iOS device there’s no iOS App. You have to go into Widgets and add Battery in order to see the level. Another issue is it should either charge via lightning or USB c cable, not micro USB. I understand it was bought from someone, but they could have changed the way it charges to be in line with Apple products. Other than that, I like the sound very much. The price was very reasonable. The battery life is awesome,",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Very uncomfortable headphones, super tight and rigid. After just 2-3 hours use on plane, my ears hurts like hell and I have to take it off. By comparison bose headphones are so much more comfortable you don’t even feel like they were there, I regret deeply trying to save some money and not getting the Bose instead.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was a little worried about if I would be able to use these headphones for all my gym activities, but no longer! The color is amazing, bass and sound quality are perfect, and the Bluetooth connection (including how far you can walk away from your phone) work great for me. I ran in these and they didn't even budge. People were talking about the plastic on these, but the quality seemed great to me. Nice and light as well which I can appreciate in the gym. Love these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These lasted less than 3 months! Do not buy these. The quality of the product is obviously lacking. The number of people that report them breaking says a lot. For everyone that comes back and writes a negative review there are probably 10 that have problems. They work great initially, but simply do not last anywhere near long enough to merit the cost.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"1-Does not sync well with my Android phone, there is a constant clicking noise when linked ith blue tooth, and when linked with wire, sound is only in one ear. Ok for podcasts not for music.

Tengo tres meses que los compre y ya no sirven me salieron de muy mala calidad no recomiendo que los compres😡😡,1.0 out of 5 stars
I love these headphones. I wear them to the gym regularly and use them for work conference calls. What blows my mind is I've only had to charge them maybe 4x in the several months that I've had them! Amazing product. The only negative is that they become a little uncomfortable after about 40 min esp if you're wearing earrings. But most of them do.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Super easy to sync with my iPhone and iPad. Good quality sound for a wireless set. The range and battery life are amazing. I can leave my iPhone in my locker at the gym and roam the whole building during my workout without losing signal. The only negative is that they make my ears a little warm when I wear them while exercising.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is amazing and the battery duration is very long lasting.

I loved mine while they lasted. Now only one side works when I connect it through bluetooth. The head pad that it has is going to come off really fast after you use them for a couple of months.

As people have pointed out, it's just dissapointing that you're paying a premium price and you're not quite what you expect.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for my Wife - she loved them so much I bought another pair (not pink!) for myself and I have to say that overall, when paired with iPhone, they are amazing. Extreme battery life. Fast charging and sync very nicely.

I did have to buy earphone covers to use them for running though as they have a moisture shutoff that triggers if you sweat a lot.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I travel a ton for work and rely on headphones that will reduce the white noise of the planes engines when attempting to watch movies/shows or listen to music. These headphones were great at achieving that and super great in instantly connecting with my apple products. Two stars were taken off for general build quality as the connection point for the right ear broke upon adjustment after just a few months. Would consider buying new model if build issues were resolved.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"bought for 13 year old son for his birthday. This was the best price I could find after looking around online and in local stores. I wasn't entirely sure my son would like the gold color, but he was thrilled by them and they're much more fun than the basic black. He's had them almost two months with lots of daily use. I like that they come with a case to take them along with us in the car or traveling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Beats delivers amazing quality in their solo 3 wireless headphones. Long lasting battery life and quick charges allows for tons of listening time. High quality sound and a beautiful Disney design makes these great for any music and Disney fan.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Headphones worked fine until sliding function broke. We used tape to hold it in place. Sent the product in and they refused to honor the warranty because applying tape was an ""unauthorized modification"". The tech couldn't care less and I've heard this is commonplace for Apple. They have your money...and guess what...they will gladly send you a new pair at ""market value"" which is currently $40 more than I paid for them. They broke within 2 months of ownership. Guess my son will have no headphones for his virtual school he is forced to attend. Thanks Apple for your compassion and commitment to reliability!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was very hesitant on buying Beats because normally they're heavy on the bass and muffled on the treble. Not with the Solo3. These were extremely well rounded in the Bass/ Treble. Don't get me wrong, these headphones have a lotta Bass at a high volume and the treble is adjusted acoustically to sound normal and not muffled. At a low volume, the treble jumps out at you with a crystal clear sound and the bass is adjusted to a low roar.

The weight is pretty well distributed. They sit pretty well on your head with no extreme tightness on the ears or the head. Yes, they sit on the ears instead of over the ears. I didn't realize this until I received them. I have used some like this in the past and didn't care for the feel or the sound of them. Once I tried on the Solo3, I could tell this wasn't the same story like in the past. The leather padding is great. A pillow - like feel on the ears makes these comfortable to wear for hours. Adjusting them is very easy also. Just pull , right above the headphone, up or down to fit your ear height. Also the headphones fold inward for easy storage.

Battery usage is definitely a plus on these Beats! Their claims that it last about 40 hours is right on target. The first time I used them, the battery lasted about 38 hours but after I charged them it went as long as 42 hours on a single charge so go figure. The 10 minute fast charge does last a good 3 hours so that is definitely a plus in my book.

As for looks, you can't go wrong. Typical Beats good looks, just packaged in a smaller size. I went with the flat or matte black. I don't care for the ""fingerprint"" look so I didn't go with the glossy black because reviewers say it is a fingerprint magnet.

Connection is a breeze with Bluetooth and even better if you have the iPhone 7. If you don't have the iPhone 7 or iOS 10+ then Bluetooth connectivity is as usual: turn on the Bluetooth on your device and look for Solo3. For IPhone 7 or iOS 10+ just turn on the Bluetooth and connect it once and your iPhone will remember the Solo3. Now, the next time you turn on your Beats headphones it will automatically connect to your iPhone.

The Beats Solo3 package came with its own storage bag, USB A-to-USB micro-B for charging and a male to male 3.5mm cord to use the headphones without the use of the Bluetooth.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Not sure what the previous buyers received but I just got these Solo3 headphones December 2019 and they are phenominal! I was nervous ordering them after reading the previous reviews, but I’m SO glad I ignored them in this case. The packaging is legitimate and everything that is supposed to come with them comes with them. The sound is A++ and the noise cancellation is perfect! Buy them! They are worth it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These aren’t advertised to be noise-canceling, so I’m not sure why I’m asked to rate that aspect. My only complaint is that the ear cups hurt my ears over time; I’m not sure why they’re smaller than the Beats and Beats 2 I also own. I love the sound and the wireless feature - holds a charge forever!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I use my beats every day to listen to music, podcasts, and audiobooks.

You do have to break them in though, they hurt really bad for the first few days after only an hour or two of wearing and I have a small head.

They also get stretched out and then become too loose, so I can't use them to work out or really do anything but sit or walk while wearing. I don't even trust wearing them while washing dishes because they'll slip forwards off my face.

I love my beats but I wish they were designed to fit better.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I got these things as a gift from my wife last Christmas. By June the black cover around the ear piece began to fall off. Called in and covered under warranty and replaced no problem. Fast forward 6 months doing same exact thing but warranty no longer applies after they are replaced once. Definitely won’t buy this brand ever again. Shortly after the foam wore off they completely quit working on the right side. Technically $200 for 6 months of use,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Solo3 will not disappoint! If you're looking for headphones with crippling bass these ain't it. However, the balance of sound from high, low and mid is amazing! The bass doesn't drown out the others, nor do the others cancel the bass effect. Just a well rounded pair of headphones. Love them!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I didn't read the reviews before purchasing these, but after hitting the purchase button I decided to go through some and see if there was a common issue. Well, I kept seeing that people were reporting getting fakes/refurbished products. So I became alarmed. They were same day delivery so when I got home and saw the box I was nervous I was sent fakes or refurbished headphones. Well after doing thorough research and watching several youtube videos, I discovered they were in fact real. I have had them for a week now and my only complaint is that they are a bit tight over my ears where my glasses are, but I suppose that's my bad for wearing glasses. Otherwise, they hold a charge forever, my last beats (purchased new at Best Buy) only lasted maybe 6-8 hours. These can go a few days which is nice. The sound quality is good, though they are not noise cancelling. I didn't need that since I mainly use these in my office at work, and I want to be able to hear if someone knocks at my door or walks in. Overall, pretty good!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought this for my son. Who said the sound is excellent. The ear muffs ""just"" covers the ears. but this is fine watching my son who plays D1 HS Basketball he'll take this off and leave around his neck. Because the ear muffs are small it doesn't get in the way under his chin. We tested the range some bit. No problem about 30ft. away. Sound and stream was still excellent. of course you'll always have the disance limitations set forth with Bluetooth tech specifications.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They were beautiful and great sound but hurt my ears. I ended up returning these and getting a really nice pair of off brand, over the ear headphones and they are much more comfortable than these and have just as equally good sound quality and noise cancellation. It was very disappointing these didn’t work out.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros: These headphones have great quality sound.
Cons: they smash my ears so after wearing them for any period of time my ears are sore. Overall they are not comfortable to wear. Additionally the case that they come in is ever so slightly bigger than the headphones so they have to be put in the case perfectly to fit.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are great quality headphones. I have owned a bunch of Beats headphones in the past but this is my first wireless pair. The bluetooth function works great and they can be converted to wired headphones just by plugging in the included wire. Sound clarity is amazing along with the bass. The only issue I have with these, as with all solo's, is that after having them on your head for an extended time they will hurt your ears/ make them sore. I would opt for he studios if you can.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Really happy with the product. The only downside is that they sent the wrong color ( it was supposed to be gold and they are rose gold) unfortunately I leave to see my family next week and could not return. They are a gift for a boy so it’s kind of sad. Other than that, they work great!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"For $200 I expected these to last longer than 3 weeks! Within a 3 week time span the sound went completely out in one ear and was off and on in the other ear, by week 5 there was no sound coming out of the headset at all! They were a birthday gift to my son and I have not been able to get them replaced or repaired, so I just wasted $200. I will never trust Beats ever again!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these headphones for my sons birthday last November. He loved them. Couldn’t be happier. About 2 weeks ago he started having trouble with the right headphone. Sometimes he could hear out of it and sometimes he couldn’t. It finally gave out. He was so sad and I was frustrated because the 12-month warranty is about to expire. I contacted the company I purchased it from on amazon and they were wonderful. Answered my email right away and they should be sending replacement headphones. I’m

"I ordered these beats because I could no longer wear my airpods with my new tragus piercing. The sound quality is great and the battery seems to last a really long time. My biggest complaint is that these are super uncomfortable for my ears. they hold on tightly and it’s like my ears are sore when I take them off. If it weren’t for that, I’d give them 5 stars. The color is nice and they seem durable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love my beats. Sounds great, easy to connect to my S8 phone or iPod. Battery last long. Charges fast. I use it during my train ride to work or workouts. My only regret is getting them in silver where the earpiece is white. They get dirty and you have to be careful cleaning them without damaging it. Otherwise, it's a great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not going to delve into the subjective territory of sound quality. I will say that the sound is rich and performs better than expected (especially given Beats' history of emphasizing bass). The battery life is stellar and Bluetooth connection has been impeccable with amazing range and only rare hiccups. My one complaint is that it is a snug fit on my ears: after 1-2 hours, they actually start to hurt my ears a little.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for my son who wrestles. He rocked these before 87 individual matches to get pumped up. No complaints. No issues with sweat. Great batter life. He's completely 100% content. 3 star on noice cancelling, but they aren't advertised as such. Eveything else is great.",5.0 out of 5 stars

SO happy with my purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited so long to buy the headphones. I tested them at an Apple Store and was amazed by the sound fidelity and bass. Even my wife was impressed. But I wasn’t in a good financial status, so I skipped the purchase at the time. That was last year. I heard about Amazon Prime days and decided to wait. The Solo 3 was the 1st thing that popped out when searching for electronic devices. And for $139 this time I would not let it pass away. Simply the best headphones that I have bought. And let me tell you I have bought many.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Good quality sound, looks nice, but cheap quality. However the first one I got malfunctioned with virtually no physical damage. I got a replacement. However the replacement broke a few months later again with no physical damage. I am disappointed.

I got these on Prime Day for a discounted price. I am not a headphone connoisseur but I was looking for something that was a little more suited for the office than my wireless in ear headphones I use at the gym. I have a loud intern that sits next to me who is the life of the office and needed something to block the noise out. It works. A little too well sometimes. I jump out of my skin at least 4 times per day when someone touches my shoulder or I see them out of the corner of my eye. Works for me.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've been a content user of corded, over-the-ear-headphones forever, always barely tolerating the cord getting hung up on my office chair several times a day... I've also been a bit of a snob about the Beats brand, shunning the brand hype and the expense. Not sure what put me over the edge, but I couldn't be happier that I made the leap/cut the cord. These headphones are fantastic. Battery life is excellent - I've had them for about 2 months and the battery still is half-charged. Great bluetooth range, superb sound. I use them daily at my desk job and at home (yard work, wood working projects, etc.). The controls on the headset are slick as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love these things because they cancel out loud, obnoxious noises (like your animals whining while you're trying to focus and study for a big test). They are also very comfortable to wear.

I was surprised by the solo 3s good sounding. Use them as workout headphones. Not worth 300 but got them on sale and they are good sounding plenty of volume not to bass heavy but got good sound and bass to them. And still using them to work out with no problems. Of course they always go back into the case.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent fit powerful sound I actually gave these to my daughter she wanted some wireless headphones for when she works out at the gym these have met her expectations and more they are very comfortable she said I have tried them on and they are very comfortable with that and the sound is great if you’re looking for the beat sound with the wireless capability then I would recommend these,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I really like these headphones overall, the sound quality is good and they're decently noise-isolating. HOWEVER, I've had them only for about a year, and the battery life and their condition has declined significantly. While previously I only had to charge them once a month (with use for HOURS daily) now they barely last a few days. In addition, one of the side hinges is broken, and that side of the headphones doesn't stay collapsed, and will kind of swing out at random. In general, I like these, but please be warned that they probably won't last much more than a year and a half with normal use. Personally, I think they're far too expensive to have declined this quickly.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these in November of 2018. It’s June of 2020 and they are already broken. One ear isn’t working at all and the other if I press on it it will work otherwise it goes in and out and sounds like static. For the price, they should last a lot longer than what they did. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these head phones precisely for the noise cancellation feature.

I wear these headphones everyday to the gym and have been wearing them for a long time now. the sound quality is still amazing. the battery lasts extremely long and it charges very quick when low. one of the earphone covers just started to come undone but with the amount I have been wearing and sweating in them they still work amazing.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I absolutely love these headphones for my workouts. I previously had ear plugs and they were constantly coming out of my ear whenever I sweat so I would have to frequently stop my workouts to put back and readjust them in my ear which got super annoying when i'm trying to concentrate on burning some fat. I've been using these for about a week now and they are really great, i can focus on my workouts and the sound quality is totally bomb. i won't go into all the specs and technical mumbo jumbo cuz i don't know them, but if you're looking for something that stays put and has good sound quality and long battery life you can't go wrong with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

For a couple of days temperature dropped down under 32 deegres Fahrenheit and I have difficulties to use my headphones outside my apartment. After 5 minutes outside, headphones switching off by themself. I can not turn them back on until, I am back to a warmer place for at least 5-10 minutes. I sent a message to Beats by Dre tech support, and I received an answer saying the optimum temperature for using this headphones is above 32 deegres Fahrenheit. So it means that I not gonna be able to use this product through the winter. On my opinion Beats shoul inform customers that they could expect difficulties using this equipment in the cold environment.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I have tried a few different head phones but wanted blue tooth and smaller ear cup size so it didn't look weird while I listed at work. For the price I really dont notice a great sound difference from something like my BOHM headphones at a third of the price. I have glasses and these things kill my ear as they are so tight with no way to loosen them. I would have expect more out of something so pricey.,3.0 out of 5 stars
They were working well the first 2 weeks and then everything went down hill. The sound would start failing in the right ear until it was completely gone and I could only hear from one ear. Then it wouldn’t connect to the Bluetooth on my phone. And after a while I had to call amazon for help on what to do because I had it for a little over a month.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Best wireless headphones hands-down! These are the easiest plug and play headphones ever. Right out of the box, they come with easy to start instructions, how to use the buttons and connect blue tooth. I was up and running in less than 2 minutes. They also fold really well into a case that is included. I'm really happy with the sounds, and they are very much noise-cancelling in my opinion even though I'm not sure it's advertised to be. Very comfortable, long battery life and well worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They look great. If looks are your thing, grab these. If you don’t really care about looks and sound quality is your thing then you can definitely find something better for this price. That’s the biggest issue with Beats.. Price. But even then, the sound isn’t bad, just not good enough for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Poorly made headphones. While the sound quality and noise cancelation are great, within six months of use the padding cover started coming off. For the amount of money spent on these, that shouldn’t have been an issue. I had knockoffs that lasted years.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First problem may not be 100% Beat's fault, however, they are an Apple product. They don't play nice with Bluetooth. Failure and intermittent connection, dropped connection, both on Apple computers. Maybe not Beat's fault, but they are useless for the intended purpose if unable to establish a reliable Bluetooth connection.
Second problem, they are uncomfortably tight on the ears.
Third, the on/off switch offers no tactile functionality. The headphones must be removed and looked at in order to power on (or off).
The sound quality and noise cancelling are fine, but so is every other brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"They worked amazing for the first couple months and then I had trouble with Bluetooth connection, the aux cord thing it comes with had a short in it so it sounds static-y with it in PLUS to top it off the right side stopped working on the headphones.

Read the instructions to figure out the headset controls like volume.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Fantastic headphones that quickly became a staple in my workout routine. I enjoy the moderate noise cancellation they provide. It’s not perfect, but I never needed it to be.

I love the Beats brand. They never fail when it comes to great sound. The quality of these headphones are great. They are very durable. The color is my favorite so that is great too.

This is my second pair of beats and they are only getting better.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my second set of Beats, the first Blue tooth. These are super comfortable, and easy to install on both my iPhone and iPad. However, since I live in colder climate, if the temps are in the upper to mid 30s, the headphones only last 15 mins at the most. Even if I wear a hoodie, they don't last much longer. This happens when the battery is fully charged, so there must be a shutoff when the headphones hit a certain temp. The battery doesn't drain, it just turns off.

"After 6 months, the ear cover has separated and cannot be easily fixed. Apple support was not much help and repair would be at cost plus $100 RT uber ride to a service provider 20 miles away. My second pair of Beats that has not lived up to the hype of the Apple quality expected",1.0 out of 5 stars
The right ear shorted out after 3 months. The left ear scratches out now 4 months after I bought them. I'm really unhappy. I don't use them near water or anything strange that would lead to the short out.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"My first time spending $200 on headphones and was impressed with battery life and quality of music for a year. I connect them via Bluetooth as I have on very flight and the right earphone has no sound. I spend every minute u til takeoff trying to google remedies and disconnect/reconnect and reset. I didn’t get them wet, used the case religiously. If I had known they wouldn’t last 13 months I would not have spent that much. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was super excited to get these headphones. After about 20 minutes of wearing them, i took them off and my ears were throbbing! They are very painful to wear. I can't get past the pain so I'll be returning these, which is unfortunate because the sound is amazing and they fit me way better then the Bose soundlink headphones.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Stylish and sound great, but stopped working properly after less than a year. One of the ears goes in and out depending on your head position. A wire is probably a little loose on the inside. As pricey as these are I'd expect them to be more durable after being stored in the case and only being used lightly for a year.

Luckily they still had 6 days left on their one year warranty and Apple repaired them for free.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"My daughter absolutely loves her new Beats, she hasn’t heard a thing anyone has said to her since Christmas morning.
All kidding aside the headphones themselves are very nice. They have amazing sound quality, and they look and feel great. It took my daughter all of 3min to connect to her phone, set them up, and start listening to music.
Will buy another pair for myself, so that I can pretend not to hear my wife.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my first over the ear headphones. They pair easily with my iPhone and my Microsoft Surface Laptop for calls and music on both devices. The sound quality is good and people say they hear me clearly. I haven’t tried outdoor calls yet where it may pick up other environmental sounds.

The only negative is they get a bit uncomfortable on my ears when I wear them for longer periods. I think the ear cushions could be softer.

Next time I’ll consider spending more for more comfortable headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love these. The battery life on these last a reeeallly long time. Ear cups aren’t very large so they don’t comfortably cover the whole ear.

Easy Bluetooth connect. Wish you could Bluetooth phone calls as well. You need a wire (that comes with it) to speak on the phone.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Bought these for my sons birthday and he absolutely loves them!! I don’t personally use them but my son loves them he uses them all the time and has not once complained about them. They work as described. Well worth the money and the smile it has put on my sons face. I recommend these beats!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"My cousin needed these for her birthday, so I bought it for her. It was pretty good, she liked these so much. I have also tried these myself and over all sound quality is very good. The bass is okay, but not much deep bass with these. However, these do have the noise cancellation feature which is very good and works very well. Overall, I would say my cousin likes these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"First thing that stood out to me was the color. I am a rose gold addict lol. The next thing was how comfortable these are. Those squishy ear pieces are amazing. The battery on these seem to last forever, which is great! The sound is crisp and clean. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the bass... there just isn't enough.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great sound and are compact so they are able to fit into smaller bags when they are folded. The battery lasts pretty long, I was quite surprised. I hardly ever have to charge them and I use them almost daily for the gym. The only complaint I have is they're not comfortable when wearing with glasses. They're a big snug on the ear so they do start to hurt a little when wearing your glasses.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Your used headphones purchased at full price may come with cat fur, earwax and dandruff like mine. That’s nasty.
Also, no cords included for these Bluetooth headphones. Just the used headphones in the case inside the beats box.

"Great headphones. A little tight on ears at first, once broken in amazing sound, excellent battery life, and very comfortable. I have 3 pairs of wireless headphone and these are by far my favorite. If your in the market at 200$ range, stop buy these and be happy.

Also, these block out the world around you. Not recommend for long walks on a busy road with no side walk, you will not here it coming!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm very pleased with my purchase! Easy to connect to my Samsung S8 plus. My Beats came fully charged, and I've been using them since I took them out of the box!

You only live once, and these headphones make life great! I definitely recommend these awesome headphones!",5.0 out of 5 stars
This is a good stuff. I've used it for a long time. Not any issues. But I don't know how to discuss it. I just want to clean up the review. Because when I look at the review which hasn't reviewed that I will feel uncomfortable. That's it.,5.0 out of 5 stars
I got the glossy black. Love this product. It's legit. Battery lasts a long time. Glossy black does not scratch easily. I even hit it HARD against a piece of equipment at the gym and the dent is still so tiny and not noticeable - so it is DURABLE.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"My husband loved these. They were great with his low hearing. However, they do not stand up to use while working. They have never been wet, always kept in the case. And just after the end of warranty they quit working. We think it’s because they couldn’t stand up to use while sweating. Can’t come up with any other reason for them to just quit like that after being so well taken care of. It was almost like they shorted. He was wearing them and everything was fine mowing then lawn and the boom, they were dead.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a gift. When I opened them, I was disappointed to see that the black material did not completely cover the ear phones on either side. The beige foam sticks out all around the ear phones on both sides. When I try to stretch the black material across the earphone to cover the foam—it won’t go--it’s WAY too small and will not stay in place.
If they don’t bother to refurbish them enough to make them look good on the outside, it’s doubtful that quality work was done inside. NO ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

"Best bluetooth headphone. Period. Quality is good but most important is you dont need to pair unpair anymore in order to connect to your phone, mac, ipad, watch. It connects to all at once and while listening music from mac if you get a call on iphone then you can just switch to iphone and vice versa. This is a great feature. When I go for jog then I just connect to my watch without unpairing. I have two and my daughter loves it as she can use between her laptop, phone and ipad.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Was 92% charged when I put charger on and charged for about 10 min and they were ready to go. I’m very satisfied! I got the matte black, looks classy. These are a plus for me since those dang iphone buds don’t fit in my ear. Love, love, love!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love color and they where awesome to 4 times I got to use them. Bought these a year ago in January
I have taken very good care of them . I charged them last night so I could use them today and they would not pair. the pair light wont even come on. so I plugged them in to use and sound only comes out on the right and nothing on the right ! In my opinion . 300.00 is way to much to spend on something you only got to use 4 times. Ive had cheap ear phones that last way longer and when they bite the dust you can afford to replace them . Very Disappointed in this purchase",2.0 out of 5 stars

Please look at the pics before you make a purchase decision.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Material around the are ear headphones are separated after reading many reviews there seems to be ongoing problem I called Apple but they want to hold a credit card on file and have them mailed in.

Called support and walked me thru the reset steps, which i had already done, now they say send it in. i'M SICK OF PAYING BIG BUCKS (224.00) NOT HAVING IT FOR MORE THAN 2 YEARS AND HAVE TO GET IT REPLACED.

"Great headphones for all purposes unless you plan on wearing them when the temperature drops near 32°F or below. These headphones have a wonderfully long battery life, effortless connections to I-devices, good sound and great usability. My problem, and it’s a big one, is that is impossible to use these headphones as a wireless device when the temperature drops close to or below freezing. At that point, the headphones turn off automatically anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes later depending on how cold it is. Sometimes, when the temperatures only at 32°, I can get up to 20 to 25 minutes before they turn off. I have called Apple and I have been told that this is typical for battery powered wireless headphones. I have not substantiated this statement with other brands.",3.0 out of 5 stars
For the price doesnt sound that good its just ok it lacks mid its mostly bass its not worth $199 or $129 on sale .jbl live 400 sounds better for $ 69 ..but quality its really good.im not sure im keeping it ill try for a week will see,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Super great headphones ever have. Was having a wired Philips and a SONY headphone, but always felt painful on both ears because wrapping too tightly to ears. This Beats Solo3 doesn't make such problem to me.

In terms of BT/wireless, it works wonderfully as I have many apple products and the Solo3 connects to all of them with easy set up and very good music quality. The long durability of battery juice and long distance of reception make me thumbs up!! I work in a lab often leave my phone on desk and walk around benches and even cross the hall way to another room. I never get problem to receive BT signals from my iphone7. It's also easy to check battery status using iphone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I had another pair of these that I ordered from Apple that were stolen and I was devastated because I love them so much that I ordered another pair. They are sound cancelling and comfortable sitting over the ear. I was never into bulky headphones like this before but after owning these I probably won't get anything else. I even use them when I shoot my gun because the noise cancelling is that good. I recommend them if you are considering buying them!,5.0 out of 5 stars
Great headset. Flawless pairing with all your apple devices. Legitimate 40 hours battery life and the range across our 3 level home no drops at all. The fatal flaw is i like to walk the dog in winter; if its cold; the unit shuts off purposely at around 32 degrees and no more music for the rest of the walk; i had 2 when i realized this i returned 1. They get more comfortable with continued use; not as comfy as the bose on ear bluetooth. Overall good purchase.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Wow. If you are a bass lover and primarily listen to rap or R&B, you are certainly in for a treat. These look great and although the clarity is not quite as good as other brands such as Bose or Sennheiser, they excel in the bass department. They are sleek and beautiful making these the best looking headphones money can buy and won’t stick out if you so chose to wear them with your favorite outfit. Overall, I strongly recommend these to just about anybody looking for a great overall headphone with great sound quality, bass, battery, aesthetics, and style all in one.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"these are awful . at first I was really happy to get them and they looked really authentic and sounded great ! I’ve had them for almost a year now and as I was dancing and listening to my music, the right speaker stopped working . not to mention the circle part that allows you to change the volume randomly fell off on its own while I was listening to music maybe 6 months back . for 6 months I have been having it taped to my headphones just for them to end up trash all together . just save the money because these ain’t it .",1.0 out of 5 stars
If you like loud music beware. The wireless on these does not allow for loud music. I tested my regular Beats Solo with the same music and phone and the wireless just wont get as loud. I sent them back. Would rather deal with wires instead of not being able to enjoy loud music.,2.0 out of 5 stars

I bought these for my 9 year old for his birthday and we both love them. (I use them at the gym occasionally and have even run in them). The battery lasts forever and they look sharp but not too bulky. They are comfortable and the sound is very good.

Not too flashy but still cool looking.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have had these for about a year and a half and the left earphone stopped working. If you do research, this is a VERY VERY common problem and it is not an easy fix or you'll have to send it in for repair which costs a significant amount of money.

Let’s see if the sound quality gets better with use.",3.0 out of 5 stars
I actually like these and I am the furthest thing in the world from a Beats guy. The sound is fun they actually feel good on my head. Are the worth the $300 list price?

"Product has excellent sound quality and quick charging. The audio cord was broken when I received it. Thought no big deal since it was brand new and still under warranty. I was totally mistaken. When I called Apple to get a new cord, I was told that it was already out of warranty by two years. What??? The warranty started when the product was purchased two years ago by the seller (AMAZON) from Apple. Now that I know this, I will be very careful about what I purchase from Amazon. I ended up paying for a new audio cord.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these headphones for my son who is autistic and hopes that it would help cancel out some of the noise around us while he was watching videos or listening to music.

This is the perfect wireless combination for iPhone 7, hands down.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Not worth the price, sound is not of quality with other headphones of similar pricing, Bluetooth connectivity is spotty in a multiresidential environment and made with cheap materials.

Then in January 2019 one side of the extension area broke. Once again I contacted Apple support, however this time instead of a 1 year warranty, the replacements only had a 90 day warranty! So I could pay $129 plus S/H to get them repaired or I could spend another $200 and just buy new ones! Neither option appealed to me!!! VERY FRUSTRATED!!!!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars

"With regular use, these quit working in one ear after only a couple of months. Called Apple for repair and they wanted to charge me $129 to fix or advised that I could donate the headphones.

We got them repaired and now he hardly used them.",2.0 out of 5 stars
This is the 3rd pair of beats I have purchased from here that has broken. The all have broke in a similar way. They all have gotten a short. This pair particularly I bought brand new and they worked for like 3 months until getting a short. I recommend not to buy them from here.,1.0 out of 5 stars

"I have this product for about two years now. After about one year the cushions were totally unusable and I had to replace them. I never dropped my headphone and always treated it nicely, however, after 1.5 years the wireless connection on the right headphone was totally broken and I had to use it only with wire. Finally today, when I was taking it off of my head the right arm broke for no reason and I had to glue it unless it doesn't stay on my head. I don't like the material of this product, it's very fragile. For a premier product it's not acceptable and I don't recommend it!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"For the price of these headphones its not worth it , you're really paying for the name. At most these are $80 headphones , the bass quality is Disappointing !

"Great pair of legit easy to use Beats headphones. I registered my beats with the official Beats website and they are 100% authentic. It came in an original Beats box with easy to understand instructions . Sound quality is studio sound, noise cancellation is top notch and the material for the earmuffs is very comfortable.

Tried numerous sound settings on both my iPhone and my Mac. Still, it's solidly built but would recommend getting the extended warranty. My hunch is if used by an 'active' person (hiker, runner, etc.) the combination of natural shock absorption and sweat will increase the 'age' of the product.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"After several weeks of researching, comparing and reading reviews, we bought the Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones. I originally wanted the Bose QuietComfort 35’s or the Beats Studios. I tried them on, tested them out in-store and was having a hard time deciding. I saw a pair of th Solo3’s and tried them on, (not sure how I’d feel about the on-ear versus the over-the-eat style.) I was amazed that the Solo3 sounded just as great as the Bose (in my opinion). While not offering noise canceling, I could still hear most things around me with the Bose and Beats Studios. I felt the sound quality was just as good and I could hear just as much noise with the Solo3’s as the other two with noise-canceling. So we bought two, had them for 2 weeks now and traveled with them... we are extremely happy with them and would buy them again!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"The BEST headphones I have ever owned. Im a bit of a sucker for looks and brand which people criticize a lot of Beats users for but I say screw those people because you can have both looks AND quality with Beats. I had the beats solo 2 wireless and I cant begin to tell you what a step up the Solo 3's are. The battery life is seriously unbelievable. I use them ranging from 3-4 hours a day and sometimes up to 6 hours (I use them for work) and the battery lasts WEEKS its seriously incredible. When the battery gets low ill charge for 5 minutes and it's back up to 3 dots. It's INCREDIBLE, I dont even think my old Nokia's battery lasted this long! The finish of these headphones is about the same as the Solo 2's except for the gorgeous shiny rose gold accents as opposed to the fully matte finish of the Solo 2's. These headphones look amazing, sound even better, and the battery lasts a ridiculously long time. The price tag is hefty but as someone who uses these every day for work they were worth every penny.

I've noticed some people complaining about the same issue the Solo 2's had. It's uncomfortable to use them for an extended period of time because they are tight. Yes, at first they ARE pretty tight on your skull and are unbearable for over 2 hours. However, over time they DO stretch out and guys this happens to most On-Ear headphones. If you have very large ears I would recommend getting the Studios since they are OVER ear. If you want to speed out the stretch out process just stretch them out over something about the same size as your head and leave them overnight. Repeat this until they are comfy although dont stretch them too much or they will fall easily. I use these now for up to 6 hours at a time and they are very comfy. If you have earrings you might want to take them off before prolonged use, the back of the earrings will be poking into your skull.

Overall these headphones impressed me and this is coming from someone who already owned the great Solo 2's. You will not regret getting these.

"The sound quality was very good, but the headphones leak a lot of sound so if you're listening in a quiet place, everyone can hear your music. Also, these headphones are not headphones for being active, because they fall off a lot. The material and the quality of them though, is very good. Also very comfortable. Again though, if you plan on doing anything active, these are not the right ones. Update, the rubber cushion on the head strap came off of the headphones",5.0 out of 5 stars

Did some research and realized it’s like sticking your head in a microwave it’s so bad for you! Not sure the quality of noise cancellation outweighs the health risks associated with it.,1.0 out of 5 stars

I buy a beats solo 3 from Amzon warehouse deals and a get a fake,1.0 out of 5 stars
"This was a gift for my niece and she loves it! I will be ordering one for myself as well!! It was shipped and delivered right before Christmas. This style does not go out of style and the ear buds are super soft and handle is sleek. The black color matches with everything, that’s why she wanted it as well. I highly recommend 👍🏼",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She is in love with them. Couldn't beat the price at the time since they dropped because of Black Friday.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"First I was spectical that these were even on sale because we all know Beats are overpriced for what you get. Thank being said, since these are discounted they are definitely a great buy. I wouldn't spend $300 on these but I will $220. These are real and they came in the original packaging.

Now for the review. As others have noticed that Beats are very bass heavy, I like this even though I listen to a lot of metal but to some they don't like it. The sound populated is excellent. There aren't any cracks or interruptions at all. These are a very high quality SOUND headphone. My issue isn't with the sound or the Bluetooth connectivity.

These headphones, as other solos are, are built cheap. The sound coming out is great but the design is made out of plastic and i wouldn't recommend anyone going to the gym with these. Get the power beats if you're going to the gym. These feel like they will break and I have a feeling they will If I drop them hard enough. The ear cups re great leather quality and feel comfortable. I wish they went away with the plastic and made all the models like the beats pro were. The material in the design definitely needs work.

The Bluetooth connectivity is marvelous with this W1 chip. The range is insane. I went outside my house and down the street and was still connected without interuption. i don't understand everyone saying connecting is any different. Yes there's a pop up that says connect but all my other bluetooth headphones automatically connect after the initial set up anyway so I don't get this ""amaazing set up"" everyone is talking about.

One more thing I would like to point out are phone calls. The phone calls are so crystal clear. No one can tell I'm using headphones which is hard with Bluetooth nowadays. All around these are a great buy and I would buy them again (not for $300 of course). Sound quality is great, cal quality is great, if you can get over the plastic buy these!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I’ve onky fully charged this set of headphones once since I bought them. I’ve taken them to the gym at least 30 minutes maybe 8-10 times and haven’t had to recharge them. They fit pretty comfortably and don’t really squeeze to tight. They sound great except not as loud as a previous set that I own. Th bass is not where near what it used to be. But over all still pretty good,5.0 out of 5 stars

But i believe they are fake because the W1 chip it is supposed to have didnt connect to my ipad air 2 like advertised, and the comfort of these headphones werent the same as the ones i wore in store at best buy. And the sound quality was pathetic, my cheap asus laptop has better sound than these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"So I know everyone is seeing all these one star reviews and how they’re fake and too cheap and stuff however, I checked the serial number, and everything was in check and these are indeed 100% real beats.

If anything happens In the next 4 months, I’ll probably take this review down or just add on but bottom line is that the beats I received were in fact real beats",5.0 out of 5 stars

"The sound is amazing and they're so comfortable! I think these are the best headphones I've ever had.

IMPORTANT NOTE: You should get a hard case to store them.

Some months after the purchase, the left headphone just stopped working when connected to bluetooth, but it worked perfectly fine when I used the 3,5mm jack. Luckily, I managed to get some new ones from Apple.

My guess is that storing them in the provided fabric bag harmed somehow the wiring, since the headphones barely fit in it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Great that I received someone else's used beats... I was a little skeptical when the box was not even wrapped. When I opened it, the headphones were scratched up and the cups had earwax in them. Absolutely unlike Amazon to send used beats when they are marked as new. When I paired to the device, it already pops up as Christian's beats solo 3. So Christian, absolutely brilliant but you need to clean your ears. As if that wasn't enough, the left ear just did not work at all. Very disappointed.

"These are the second pair of beats I have purchased, and they are great. I know they get a lot of complaints by music professionals as not being ""the"" top quality music output. However, to my amateur ears, I think that they are perfectly fine. The battery lasts forever....I usually have to charge them only every 2-3 weeks, and use them almost every day. Compared to pretty much any other rechargeable product, their battery life is amazing. I don't know how many long haul flights I have planned, and the morning of realized that I had forgotten to charge my ipad/computer...etc. These headphones are great, since they last so long. The music quality is more than sufficient for me, and the fact that they fold up means I can throw them in my purse pretty easily. I use them on my commute, for travel, and when I work out!

"Unfortunately, I am going to return these, and for one simple reason: Even with a full charge, the headphones shut off after being in the cold for as little as 15 minutes. And I'm not talking about arctic temps, I'm merely outside in mid-20's degrees, and the battery shuts down. I looked at the beats website and other sites, and this is a well-known design flaw.

I love them. Easy to pair with my car and Android phone. Beautiful. Expensively made. A little tight at first but better tight than lose for years of wear because the leather may give in time and you don't want them falling off. Sound quality could use improvement.

Aside from defect disappointment of this pair, highly recommend the brand.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"These are so awesome. I really wanted wireless headphones that would stay put while I was working out, and these do a beautiful job with that.

Even using different EQ settings it just didn't have the quality of sound I've found from less expensive Bluetooth headphones. They have great battery life and range, but if you like to hear bass like, like a bass chello. Forget it. Even in deep bass EQ. it's a no go.

(I was sponsored by a company to buy these headphones) I bought them for 12$ for a month (Tax). The headphones are really great sounding which is always expected by beats. Although the sound quality is great the Plastic that they are made of is poor. The headphones fall off your head easily so playing sports with these headphones are really not recommended. So don't play sports in these the moment they fell off my head scuffs all over and a piece came undone but was easily able to be fixed,3.0 out of 5 stars

These headphones worked fine yesterday and most of today. Then suddenly the sound is super muffled and I have no idea why. Not sure if I got a defective pair or if these are knockoffs.

"Bought Beats Solo3 about a month ago or so. The sound is great but they are very very tight. I gave them to my 6 year old daughter. Would not recommend unless they make them with different sizes. I am very upset to pay that kind of money. I hate to return things. I guess I learned my lesson, next time I get an expensive product I'll just go in store not Amazon.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had these headphones since my freshman year of college. That was four years ago. They have been dropped, thrown, worked out in (sweat on), and used for leisure.

"It would have received 5 stars for quality but the top part that rests on top your head gets unfotable after a while. Also I stopped using it for about 3 days and once I used it again I couldn't turn them off, so I left it alone for about and hour and came back and the light turned off, so I tried to see if I could turn them back on but I could not. I returned it for a refund.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"Wanted a decent pair of wireless headphones after always catching a cord at work and breaking other pairs. I looked at a few pairs, these, some Bose headphones and some V-Moda. Honestly these probably had the lowest reviews of the 3. Not bad reviews, but lower than the other two in general so I was hesitant. I also had never read great things about older Beats, but they came down in price some to about 70 less than the other two so I decided to give it a shot.

I am pleasantly surprised. I am by no means an audiophile so that may help, but I think they sound very good. Pretty full sound, I don't think it's the best by any means, but it's a good sound and enjoyable to listen to. Range also seems really good on the bluetooth.

As far as comfort. They definitely could be tight to some. They kind of clamp down on the ears. I don't find this bad, but it's definitely something to consider in a purchase. I think overall they are very comfortable so far. A little hot under the ears after a bit maybe, but not bad.

I would recommend them if you want a decent pair of wireless headphones. Good sound, easy to pair, comfortable. Oh, and it also came with 30 bucks on the itunes store or 3 months of apple music. Since I will use that it's like I saved another 30 bucks on them which really makes them a great deal.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great depending on where you live.

"I am extremely pleased with this purchase. First of all, it arrived on time and in great condition. I was a bit skeptical about purchasing due to some of the comments that I read, however, I decided to bite the bullet and make the purchase. There were concerns if the headphones were genuine (as in, true Beats)- yes, they are. These Beats by Dre wireless headphones are the best, I do not know why I waited so long to make the purchase! The sound is crisp and clear and my music sounds like it is live.

Setup was not difficult and I like that it automatically pairs with my phone so I can listen to my music. I have a Samsung S7 and it works perfectly- no problems at all.

I purchased these headphones for the gym. I lift weights, spin, and run in them. I have not experienced the issue some people complain about regarding sweating (and I tend to sweat when I am running). My headphones still stay on my head. For those that have that issue, I would recommend tying a scarf on your head. It will help hold the headphones in place.

Overall, I am a satisfied customer.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are trash to put it simply. The sound quality is not as good as I thought it would be. I had the original beats the they first came out and those were so much better in terms of sound and product quality. I was really excited about these but ended up very disappointed. I'm returning them for my money back. Not at all impressed.,2.0 out of 5 stars

Purchased the headphones April 2017. By April 2018 the cover on the headphones started to come off.

I would suggest get an extended warranty if you are going to buy these are buy another product.,1.0 out of 5 stars

"I got these a few days ago and they were perfect, I had a long debate on whether I should get the Bose headphones or these Beats. The Beats won out. However after only a few days of ownership they are already malfunctioning. On two separate occasions while working out at the gym the volume levels would change on their own. Which doesn’t seem too bad I guess But considering these headphones are over $200 I was hoping for a good quality product. I am currently waiting on replacements and fingers crossed this doesn’t happen again otherwise I guess I will just go for the Bose.

Update: decided to just get a refund and go with another brand entirely after reading more negative reviews",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless headphones and bought the Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones yesterday. I did a side by side comparison and I gotta say, the Solo 3's sound better.... way better. I know Beats are geared more toward a the low end of the sound spectrum, but I played Hip Hop, Classical, Country, Rock and some Acapela. Every test had the Solo 3's as the clear winner. Even down to the sound isolation, and the Studios have ""noise cancellation"".

There's only one negative, it is the carrying case. Could they not make it a tad bigger?! I feel like just one more centimeter of room would have shaved at least 3 minutes off putting them in the bag. ;)

I have to be transparent, I got these for $210 on another large retailer's site (think the rain forest). Would I pay 300 plus tax? Probably, but the point is, you can't find them for less, just make sure the place you're buying them from is legit.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Heads-up - this is a lengthy review - but when you are considering a headphone at this price you deserve as much review as you can get to help you decide! I will rate by topic so you can also focus on what is most important to you. Let's start with context. These are my first Beats headphones - wired or wireless. They are not of course my first wireless or wired headphones. I have several wireless headphones including Jabra Move and Jaybird BlueBuds X. I also have several wired headphones with my favorites being KEF M500 (on ear) and Oppo PM-2 (over ear). My sound preference in a headphone is crisp and clear highs and mids with a presence and ""definition"" of bass - but not over done. Yea, I'm not a bass-head. So here we go...

WIRELESS (5 / 5):
Right off the bat, this is where these headphone excel, and why I considered and bought them in the first place. They are by far the easiest bluetooth headphones I have used to pair and manage with multiple devices. This of course assumes you are very deep in the Apple eco-system - which I am. I use these headphones with an iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Initial pairing was simple and automatic with my iPhone - place it next to it, turned it on, hit accept and done. Then in seconds the headphone showed up in all my Apple devices! And switching between what device is connected and active is just as easy. I could never get previous wireless headphones I owned to play nice with multiple devices even though they supposedly supported this feature. One wireless headphone always went back and forth between my iPhone and iPad even when I was in the middle of listening to music on my iPhone. Not so with the Solo3! And the range and battery life are incredible. I have owned my Solo3 for over a week and I am still on the initial charge. So hands down wireless performance is the best feature of these headphones.

COMFORT (4 / 5):
The Solo3 is an on-ear headphone and for me they are actually quite comfortable. The leather pads are comfortable and seal well - though they are not as soft as the pads on my KEFs. But maybe they will soften over time. The ""clamping"" of the Solo3 is firm and keeps the headphones very stable during moderate activity but not so tight that they bother my ears at all. The headband liner is comfortable for me too - I don't seem to have the rubbing problem some people have mentioned. And the plastic construction (see again under quality) actually has one plus in that it keeps the headphones light. I almost don't notice they are on my head until... The good seal and firm/thick pads cause my ears to heat up after about 30 mins so I do have to take them off for short ""cool-down"" breaks.

QUALITY (3 / 5):
This is a hard one to judge short term so my rating here is certainly preliminary. Bottom line - admittedly there is a lot of plastic here. Yes, it is a plus under comfort as it keeps the headphones light. But when you get in to this price range you defiantly see more metals and leathers and less plastic. And some wired headphones I have are so solid they have lasted me over a decade! I am not sure I will be able to say that about these headphones. And a 1 year warranty is not very confident - some headphones starting at this price point offer up to 3 years. It would certainly inspire confidence if Beats backed these a bit more and made me feel like the plastic construction was solid and truly there for comfort (weight). That said its too early to bash longevity yet.

SOUND (4 / 5):
Ok now the final and most subjective topic - the sound quality. Recall my sound preference - not a bass-head. When I first heard about these headphones with the new wireless chip - I was interested because of all the hassles I had before with bluetooth headphones. But because they were Beats I struggled to decide to purchase or not. I have not owned Beats because Beats headphones I listened to in the past were definitely too much bass for me - thudding and muffled. But I decided to give it a try - I could always return them. They are not going back! The sound is actually a pleasant surprise. Yes, they are more bass then what I own now - but they sound more balanced then what I remember. You can hear good mids and highs - though they are certainly more reserved. And the spatial separation is very good - these give a full and well spaced sound that makes you feel like you are indeed in the middle of the studio or concert. They excel with more Rock then Classical, so there still is a place for my wired headphones, but I also don't feel like I have to sacrifice sound quality to get wireless convenience.

OVERALL (4 / 5):
Overall, these are very good wireless headphones - they are now my primary go to wireless headphones for sound quality and convenience across all my Apple devices - though I am keeping my set of wireless Jaybirds for intense workouts only. They are even what I turn to now over my wired headphones for most music/podcasts unless I want to immerse myself in some Acoustic, Classical or Jazz where I still prefer my wired options. Value is good - plastic to price ratio is not ideal - but it is offset by the wireless simplicity and sound. If you want a no-compromise wireless experience, you should at least consider these headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars
At this point I have had the headphones 4 months and now they won't connect to Bluetooth. I also tried to connect them to a PC for an update but they will not connect via USB. I have tried to reset the headphones but that didn't work either. In contact with Apple Support now. This is my second pair of Beats and the other ones had to be sent in to be repaired because the right side stopped working.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I got these headphones 4 months ago and for the first two months, the were great. A couple of months in, I started to have some connectivity issues and the earpads started separating from the base. Then the rubber headband started to come off.
Finally, a couple of days ago, the headphones died completely. I charged them to 100% and the still won't turn on. I bought wireless Sol Republic headphones a couple of years ago and they worked fine until I lost them and had to buy new headphones. I got these Beats thinking they'd be an upgrade.... They're cheaply made sold at a ridiculous price. NOT AT ALL WITH THE MONEY. THEY ONLY LASTED FOUR MONTHS!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Hey, So I'm writing my review on 7/18/19. I just received my beats solo 3's in the mail, and I ordered the matte black version. I read the previous comments that stated that people got fake beats in the mail and that sucks. I can't speak for those people, but the pair I received is real. I watched a couple of youtube videos to validate if mine were real and they in fact were.

Just hoping this review helps in case someone read the previous reviews of this product from this seller and was having doubts. I definitely had doubts and was nervous about getting a new pair, but am definitely relieved that mine were real and new. Hope this helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"So I have had these bad boys for about 2 weeks now. Let me tell you they work great! They came in the mail brand new sealed with all the cords and case. These have been used for gym workouts and casual listening. They do become slippery when working out hard, so I would not recommend running with these. I was skeptical at first but I have bad no issues so far. Make sure to buy a hard case as well to keep them safe!! Stand by for a later update!

UPDATE:
Going on 2 months now and they are still running strong. I used them mainly for workouts, running, and plane rides. No issues that I can detect. These are worth the money!

9 month review!!! These are still amazing. No issues yet. Keep in mind these are beats and very fragile.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Be careful. These are advertised as new and sold by Amazon directly; however, when they arrived, they don't work at all. Did not pair initially, then once paired, it went back into pairing mode every 2-3 minutes and kept losing bluetooth. Would not turn on if it was not plugged in and would not do a software update. Contacted Apple for support and it turns out the serial number on the headphones do not match the serial number on the box they came in. Apple says according to the serial number on the device, they were purchased last fall and are NOT new and have already been reported as defective. I'm very angry after spending this much on headphones, I expect them to be new and defect free. Returning for a refund and will shop elsewhere.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these particilar set of headphones for my grandson on May 27,2017. He was so excited! He receieved the headphones on May 29,2017. Three weeks ago the headphones broke . I told him it would be no problem as we bought the Square Trade insurance. Imagine my surprise to find out there was no insurance, In my grandson’s excitement he may not have done so. Nevertheless these expensive headphones should not break in four months time. I saw on order site that there was no restution for this product as the allotted time had expired.
The outcome of the product has really bothered me. Thus this email. I want to warm people against buying these particular set of headphones especially with the Holiday season around the corner. My grandson is almost 15 years old and is a responsible boy with expensive “toys”. $200+ is a lot of money to end up throwing away.

"So sad, I really wanted to like these. I used to love Beats.
The GOOD - And as far as looks go, the are fabulous - I got the rose gold & they are one of the only headphone that I actual feel fashionable wearing.
And they fit my ‘girly’ head; meaning that almost all great headphones seem to be made for guys. Why is that?! Don’t girls want the fabulous sounding headphones too (rhetorical question). Thus these fit comfortably AND they don’t look like I’m about to pilot a helicopter, mow the lawn or on the tarmac directing airplanes.
To repeat - this look and feel awesome!!
Now the BAD - the sound quality is lame. What happened Beats?? Dre?
I’m guessing that these are made to appeal to a wide variety of listening tastes.
Yes, they are probably better than most headphones made for general call/cell phone use.
Oh also GOOD - they pair flawlessly with my iPhone 7. Easy as pie to set up. And they auto connect perfectly. Also, they seem to have a better than most headphones length of Bluetooth connection.
But I must go back to my original point - the bass and over all rich quality of sold is totally lacking. It’s not horrible but it’s like listening to music “lite”, good but not great. Kinda like eating fat frozen yogurt, it isn’t bad, but is it it Haagen-Dazs... not even close",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are not made for anyone looking to seriously exercise in them. After 6 months the fake leather covering the ear pieces came off from sweat and that is even with beats protectors on. It’s now June 2018, so they two month out of the one year warranty and they simply snapped in half when I was taking them off at the gym. I keep them in a hard shell case, not rough on them. They simply feel apart from exposure to sweat during workouts. I’m very VERY disappointed",2.0 out of 5 stars

"When they worked, the sound quality was good, and it didn’t take long to charge. I bought them in August (gave them to my daughter in September for her birthday), and the mic cord came apart almost immediately - the mic cover came off). By January 1st, one side didn’t work. We’d gotten her a set of wired Beats a few years ago, and she treated them very well. The leather wore out around the ears, but there wasn’t a scratch, and she insisted they were still perfect. Because she was so good with them and used them so much, we surprised her with these wireless ones. The problems with the mic and one side were not caused by damage. The glossy finish is still in perfect condition, and she is meticulous with her things. I’m just so disappointed in the quality. The wired ones we bought a few years ago (3 sets) still work; so I guess we won’t be upgrading to wireless anytime soon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"RETURNING!!!! I opened the box and the first thing I noticed was that the headphone case was cheap. I own a pair of the Solo 2 and the case is nice soft material. This feels like a cheap backpack from the dollar store. The biggest problem was the Bluetooth. I would connect to my phone and after only 5 seconds it would disconnect every time, even when I stayed close to my phone it still disconnected within seconds, after trying over 10 times, with 4/5 battery life. I am very disappointed in the company who sent me this junk. Never buying from these people again. Buy from Best Buy. I just saw that they are $10 cheaper, and more trust worthy, straight from the store. 1/10, 0/10 if I could. Buyers Beware!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Beats Solo3 is not the best audio out there, but the crazy thing is that I find myself wearing them more often than another $500 pair of headphones that I have just because they are so convenient and easy. They fold up small and are easy to carry in a backpack, holding up well to pretty tough treatment. The battery lasts forever and if it does die, you can get a whole study session of juice for like 5 minutes of charging. Connecting to my MacBook, iPhone, or iPad is so easy using the M1 chip and the syncing of settings through iCloud that it makes connecting other bluetooth devices seem super cumbersome: Just turn the Solo3 and choose it from your list of devices (no need to disconnect from one device before connecting to the next). And finally, they look good and are very comfortable.

So even though they aren't the best headphones I own, they end up being the ones I use the most because of how convenient, tough, long-lasting, and easy they are. Even though I said the sound isn't the best, the sound is great. The only time that I can discern that they are inferior is head-to-head, and even then, for some types of music these are preferred. They are certainly tuned to handle bass quite well, but they aren't overly bass-heavy as some other reviews indicate. So the sound is more than passable, quite good, and even superior for some music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"A lot of people always seem to nitpick about about the items that they purchase off of Amazon. They always talk about how the sound quality could have been better, they always somehow find a reason that they think it's good enough to complain about the comfortability. Here's what I think about the beats that I bought:

They are one of the best headphones a person can ask for. I do not understand why people tend to complain about the comfortability when they have cushions for your ears. That's what's really important when it comes to wearing headphones that goes over your head. The sound quality is exactly what you would expect from a popular company. The sound quality is amazing along with the different colors that you can buy. When I first bought my headphones I had a question mark over my head because it wasn't turning on, but that was only because it needed to be charged. And that is the beauty of Beats Solo 3, if your headphones is dead, you can also still play music with the wires, just simply plug it in your phone and in your Beats.
I do not know if it is just me because due to the fact that I lost my other pair of Beats it's been such a long time since I touched it let alone wear it, they do seem to feel fragile, all the more reason to place a warranty on an item that happens to feel fragile. Now the question that everybody seems to be asking is ""is it true that it only takes about 5 minutes to charge the headphones completely, and is it true that the battery life last up to 40 hours."" Well the answer depends on how much you use your headphones. There is 5 LED lights that indicates the percentage of your battery of the headphones. If the LED light is on the third light, that just means that you are at least 50 to 75% of battery life left so in other words, it would take a roughly 5 to 10 minutes to charge it which isn't bad. But ultimately it is pretty fast when it comes to charging headphones especially when it turns out to be Wireless. The volume button Works along with the pause and play button, the button that turns on the wireless headphones work. It even makes that musical noise when you are officially connected to your device, and it does it again when you turn it off. I am able to extend the headphones. I am able to fold them which is a definitely a must for me because when I am finished with my headphones for the day I usually fold them.

In conclusion, if something happens to your headphone such as a shortage on the right or left side of the headphones, if you have a warranty all you have to do is just call Apple and they should be able to fix it either call Apple or whatever warranty you are affiliated with. In addition, if you have a computer or a laptop you should download this beat app where you able to update the headphones, I will not go into details but you could always look it up on your spare time. With that being said I'm giving this product and five star and whoever purchase it in the future, I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy what you bought. Not to mention that this was on sale because originally it was $300. Now in the beginning of my review I was talking about how people tend to nitpick and and complain about things that can be easily fixed. And I was very serious about that, they are the ones who bought the item off of Amazon if something happens to that item it doesn't take as much to file a complain and get a refund and get your money back after you give them back what has been broken. Since a lot of people gave it a one-star, I had to double think about me buying this. But when I purchased it it turns out to be great just as I was expecting, no issues to the point where I would want a refund.

Oh and by the way, the true difference between Beats Solo 3 wireless and Studio 3 is that studio 3 have the ability to cancel out noise, solo 3 although you are able to increase your volume the point where you are not able to hear a single thing from the outside world, there is still a chance where despite your volume being all the way up the environment that is around you could be louder than your music. So it is not fully a noise cancellation headphones. But these headphones are beneficial for me because I'm not always in an environment that is loud enough to where I have to blast it up to 100.

And this is where my review ends",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Audio quality is amazing and the design is, of course, slick. However this is the second time I've made a Beats purchase, and I've decided I won't be purchasing anymore of their products. Maybe it's because I use headphones so much, but with both products, they lasted less than half a year before something went wrong. In this case, the cushion was coming apart, and I was having trouble connecting with my laptop several times. Sometimes it would disconnect out of the blue and I would have to restart my laptop to get it to connect again. They weren't very comfortable on my ears either, so I think I'd prefer an over-the-ear headphones because this one squishes down on mine. It's a shame because the audio really is amazing! And I love the design and color, but for this price, it's not worth buying, at least not for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Got 2 pairs at once for me and my girlfriend who use them all the time with our iPhones. I have an iPhone 7 and she has an iPhone 6. I love the new pairing tech apple has in the iPhone 7's and up and these headphones are just great. You can use wires if you want to, which I think maybe makes the base a little better, though I am not sure how accurate that is. Either way, I LOVE THESE headphones! One thing I am surprised about is the battery life on these things. I charge them once a week and often fall asleep with them on Audible and wake up to them still playing all night and still only charge about once a week. The battery life is amazing, the range is amazing, the weight and design, packaging and comfort is just all top notch. I thought the battery life might be due to the W1 chip in my iphone 7 which uses the same tech as the Air Buds, but my girlfriend who uses regular bluetooth with her iPhone 6 reports the same ridiculous battery life. She also says that she charges hers once or twice a week. These are easily the most comfortable beats thus far for over the ear. Head fatigue is almost non existent.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Item arrived on time and well packaged. This was my first ever Beats product and I absolutely love it. These headphones are much better in my opinion than either the Bose noise cancelling headphones or the Jabra headphones I have used in the past. Excellent sound with rich bass and easy to use functions. As others have mentioned these headphones do have a deep bass sound which I think is great. The re-chargebale battery is wonderful and I still have not had to charge them after a month of a fair amount of use. They even fold up to put into the little storage bag that comes with them. These headphones work particularly well with my Apple devices as there is an Apple wireless chip in them. These are great mid-range headphones for a fair price. Quite frankly, these are the best headphones I have ever had. I highly recommend them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Just a heads up, these are knock offs. Pieces were falling apart the second I opened the box so that was my original reason I started the return process. I had no experience with beats so after I decided to return them because they were falling apart I went to Best Buy and tried on a pair, when then I realized they were not the same thing at all. I’m really surprised amazon is allowing this. I didn’t believe the other reviews, I thought they had some accidental fluke. Nope, they’re completely fake and very cheap bad plastic. Save your money and your time. $20 ear buds would be a wiser purchase, or save a little more and buy the real thing.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound was good, but the ear piece part was small for my taste. It put a lot of pressure on the outside of my ears...it wasn't super comfortable. If you have large ears, you may want to try them on first. But sound wise, they were great.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Let me start by saying that I got Beats after they lowered the price to $150 (I think they were $300 or something like that before September 2019). If I had to pay $300 I'd probably send them back and try some other brands known for the sound quality (Bose, Sony). Anyway, for $150 I'm pretty happy with the purchase.
First of all, they are very stylish. If you're looking for a product with a cool design, you won't be disappointed. I personally like the way they look and it feels good to have them on. Beats are easily adjustable, not too heavy, overall they fit pretty well.
It's super easy to connect them to all Apple devices. iPhone, iPad, MacBook, you name it. I connect them to a few different devices and never have any issues.
Unfortunately, the sound is not that great. It's not bad but I personally don't see any difference between beats and regular AirPods. I was expecting more for $300 headphones. Also, I don't recommend using beats when you work out and move a lot (running, jumping, cardio exercises). Other than that I have nothing to complain about. I think they are worth $150 but this review would be way different if the price was 2x higher.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are great! They are authentic and come in the original packaging. I use them mostly to study (I listen to static noise) and I wear them during my runs. They fit a little snug, but that may be because I have a large head. They feel most comfortable without my glasses and earrings.
When I listen to music the sound quality is amazing. I put them on when I am cooking and it really puts me in the groove. My chef skills have definitely been enhanced following the purchase of these headphones. If you can't cook, buy Beats for some good eats!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This purchase was a part of my rookie intro into headphones. I travel about 80% of the time with my job, airborne, and was having a hard time finding headphones that were both compact and functional. I bought these on a whim during Amazon prime day - since they were on sale - and only wore them a handful of times. They are nice and have good sound quality, but after only 30 minutes of use, start to REALLY hurt your ears... Especially since they sit right on top of your ears. To put it into perspective - I am a petite framed female with normal to small ears. I imagine if they are uncomfortable on me (5’2 / Small oval shaped head) they would certainly be uncomfortable on most people. I ended up purchasing Bose QuietComfort 35. The price point hurt, but holy %*!@ has it been worth it. I can wear my Bose headphones all day (literally) with zero discomfort. Plus, you can remotely manage them with their app. My advice - spend the extra money and buy something else. Even my cheap pair of Sony headphones were more comfortable than the Beats. Not hating - hoping this helps.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Like many others, I read the reviews of all products and filter out the reviews I feel are retaliatory or based on a shipping/seller problem verses a product issue. BUT, in this case my biggest and only issue with the Beats Solo3 is the product! It's made from cheap materials and not as impressive as the marketing campaign that launched the Beats brand. They are made of flimsy plastic, the ear cushions are made of foam and pleather that becomes oily, have fit issues, fiction and performance problems and the additional heat they generate around your ears is astonishing (maybe i should use these while snowboarding)! I've had mine for 5 months and shocked on how many issues I've had so far. Some background, I buy A LOT of items through Amazon and other retailers (some people might say I have a problem, I say I have my PhD) and this one of the worst purchases I've made! Issues I've experienced so far include; won't charge, won't turn on, won't turn off, Bluetooth not connecting to an iPhone or the car, pleather ear covering ripped on the left ear, plastic sleeve housing left speaker broke and now held together with rubber bands (about to upgrade them to electrical tape though 👍🏼) now the entire left ear housing has broken and will also get the electrical tape treatment. DO NOT waste your money or PLEASE go into a store so you can see them for yourselves and you'll be prepared for what your getting. I wish I could still return mine......procrastination gets you every time!!!

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I used to have the Solo 2 wired beats and, after many cable replacements, I figured an upgrade to the wireless would be my solution. After nearly a year without beats, considering my stubborn self didn't want to pay for yet another replacement cable, getting back to these was like heaven. They sound absolutely amazing, providing a wide range and and depth in the music. I barely put them up past half the volume and am just stunned by the quality. Even though the Solo 2 were already fantastic, they truly outdid themselves on the Solo 3.

My only issue, which I'm unsure if it's an issue for everyone or just me, is that the clip for the bag and accessories was rather loose and did not close correctly. This caused me to lose all of my accessories and the bag. Luckily I had been wearing the beats at the time so I didn't lose those but I was incredibly upset that I could have and did lose some stuff. However, Amazon support was great and solved the problem quickly.

All in all, I really love these headphones so much. They have a great feel and sound and the ability to go cordless is such a fantastic feeling.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these headsets to replace a set of in ear headsets (Mpow) that just never quite were satisfactory for use at the gym and for general use. Never thought an over the ear product would work for me until I read the reviews on these Beats Solo 3 by Dr. Dre. So I had to try them.
This is my initial unsolicited review after about a week. I have the matte black color, which sometimes Amazon varies in price to drive choice. I got mine at a good time, though- Cyber sales- so it was a very competitive price.
What did I expect going in? Before I opened the box (quite a package, if you're into that sort of thing!) had good confidence that the bass sound quality would be outstanding from reputation of the Dr. Dre Beats brand. Rewarded in that regard and many other aspects as well.
Besides that though, there is a wired connection cable, and a charging cable packed inside and all the 'foo-foo' packaging you might expect from Apple, just to mention accessories you might expect.
I'm going to concentrate on what most people buy a headset for. So let's get on to the important stuff:
• Sound quality. It's unlike and greater than 90% of the headsets I have used. As an audio engineer (my past life) I have used plenty. The size of the cups is not an unusual one if you wear a lot of headsets- just over the ear as opposed a full surround, found I prefer this style these days.
• Great build quality/design of the ear cups. Fit well and very comfortable. I can easily wear for an hour at a time. After that, they begin to feel warm-ish (read I want to take them off for awhile). Most of my wear is inside the gym, haven't gone outside for a run with them, may be different impression.
• Outstanding battery life. I got them at what appeared to be 100%, apparently they weren't though. On my iPhone (11 Pro) when I looked, the power read 50%. SO I thought to run them down to the ground. I put them on days later and it read 25%. Used further for a work out for 1.5 hours and still good (20%). Gave up and recharged 'em. I will report back on a running time after full charge.
• Isolation. An over ear headphone has MUCH BETTER isolation from external sound by it's nature of the cups surrounding the ear. I my opinion these headsets DO NOT need further noise cancellation, with the possible exception of air travel. Further noise cancellation would likely affect sound quality. Have not tried the noise cancellation version which is MUCH more expensive. I have a pair of Sony noise cancelling over-the-ear type headsets for travel that do not sound as good as these but cancel plane noise VERY WELL. The thing is, they don't sound as good.
• Controls and pairing to several devices. Bluetooth is flawless and fast to pair to new devices (admittedly all Apple). Controls on the headset (pause-play,volume up/down) are VERY responsive. I did find that going from one device paired to another always requires that the second pairing be connected at the device again. The headset want to stay paired to the original device until a new device is paired. Once you have that concept it's easy to switch between sources.
• Microphone on a call sounds great to the caller and the caller sounds great in the headsets. I don't know where the mic is exactly but wherever, it works!
Listening test. I'm listening to the headsets as I write this review. I enjoy music and my favorite sounds are nothing short of magnificent played on these headsets. My positives about that are fabulous bass (expected). My only criticism is the ""mushy"" highs. So I had to engage an equalizer to improve the highs for me. On Music app you can fool with the settings. I pictured what works for me and I admit to some hearing loss, so what it means to you is only that there is no actual reproduction of ultra low bass (<30-40Hz, I'm guessing) or ultrahigh frequencies (>12KHz), which I think is to be expected on these type headphones. What is there is fairly well flat but could use boosting (again for me) and tweaking in the mid-range high frequencies. I feel that resulted in a major improvement. In my case with known music as the source and still with a bit of bass coloration, I found a sweet spot, to EQ settings as shown in the picture.
Review conclusion. An outstanding quality product! If there 4.75 stars I would give it that overall rating. Actual Rating. I'm taking off 1 star overall for less than perfect sound, likewise the bass quality because it was too overpowering out of the box and affected the frequency response. Apple knows something about audio and many folks will disagree with me. OK. My fix was minor on the computer source. However the fix for iDevices is not as easy, though I'm betting there is an app for that or soon will be because it's worth doing.
I may just get that app and use it, because these headsets are a pleasure to wear and use.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love these headphones, we will buy another Beats Solo3 next month after we save up. A bit spendy as compared to Sony 950 set that we returned last week, but absolutely night and day difference in sound quality. The Sony set had superb bass, but there was a trade off as treble and midrange suffered quite a bit (lacking). These Solo3 have a very balanced and deep bass, as well as detailed midrange and treble. Probably the treble was a tiny bit lacking, but full treble can be harsh I have found. I was thinking my Planetronics Backbeat did better with overall sound but after listening to them again to compare, I found the Solo3 has the mid and highs covered better as it takes the ""harshness"" out of a lot of it. Kind of cuts off the harshness of not only the treble and mids, but also the bass . No overpowering bass, but totally enough to make me happy . Listen to a lot of dubstep, and these are very pleasant sounding with that genre of music !!

Folding them up to put in the carry case didn't feel like I was going to break them, which I was worried about before I purchased. For the price they can not be beat, very happy (oh did I say that already) ? lol",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Update January 18 2019
After having to have my beats replaced FIVE times in less than a year, a person in a higher position talked to me. He made sure I got a new pair of headphones AND a new warranty. I did send them in for a replacement two days ago, because the ear coverings had started coming off again and would not stay in with the card trick. So I had that done while it was under warranty. I know that these beats won’t last forever, I am currently seeking a better alternative for when that happens.

Let me first say, I love my beats. The sound is much better than the past beats headphones. But the build quality is horrible. I knew they didn’t have the best build, but the fact that I’ve had to have my solo 3’s replaced twice in less than a year is absolutely ridiculous. I take very good care of my headphones, I’m not rough with them at all. These are way too expensive for the quality you’re getting. At least apple has been helpful.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited a year to post a review as I wanted to see if they would last. Yes the sound is great. Yes the noise reduction is wonderful, but if they only last a year, they are not worth the price! I've seen comment after comment from Beats owners that after a year or less couldn't hear sound from one side. To have them repaired is $129. There are you tube videos showing you how to tear apart the faltering side and pull wires, solder and put it back together, but if you don't have the skill set, you're stuck with Beats that only have sound in one ear. Get a less expensive pair of headphones. You'll be so much happier if they break and you are not out $229",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I rearrange my home office recently. This office is my primary workplace. In the rearrangement, my computer hutch and my desk are on opposite walls. As I moved back and forth my old standby Grado SR60 cans ended up pulling out of the headphone jack or worse pulling the computer on the floor. I was looking at the Beasts solo 3 wireless as they seemed very similar to the Grados. The price was right on Prime day.

These are on ear cans so I don't expect perfect noise cancellation. That said the experience is better than expected. The sound excellent and very transparent. I can go from bass heavy rock to string quartets without needing adjustments. Wearing duration is very good, with two to three hours with fatigue. Learned not to bend too far forward or the headphones will fall off. Bonus finding, these headphones are very good for phone calls. I was listening when paired to my iPhone when I had a phone consultation. I forgot I was wearing the beats and when I realized I did not make the switch to my usual phone headset I asked about my voice clarity. I was told the call was very clear.
Finally, the pairing to my MacBook Pro and iPhone was very easy and switching between devices is just a matter of going the menu on the device I want use and selecting the Beats.

For the environment when I use these headphones they are exactly what I want. There tendency to slip off when bending and noise leakage make them a poor choice when I am woodworking.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I kicked around the idea of buying these after I got my iPhone X, which lacks an earphone jack. At first I didn't want to spend another couple hundred dollars after I'd just spent $1200 on the phone, but I bought these on impulse while waiting for a delayed flight last weekend. I am really happy I did. I didn't read any of the reviews until after I'd made the purchase so I was concerned for....say, 30 seconds that I'd get a fake. But let me say with absolute certainty: THESE ARE REAL. I feel bad for people who ended up with knock-offs, but I got what I paid for.

This is actually my second pair of Beats, since I've had the ""sport"" version for several years. No, those ones did not wear out - they're still going strong for four years now, but I got them to wear while training for marathons and running on the road where I wanted to be very aware of traffic and my surroundings. Since then, I've migrated more to lifting and wanted headphones that would block out outside noise and let me get into my zone uninterrupted. As a gal lifting by herself, the chatter from the ""bros"" on the weight floor is still a little intimidating to me but these Beats do just the trick to help me tune that out, pay attention to only what I am doing, but still have enough awareness of what's going on around me so that I'm not the rude one who looks like she can't share space and the equipment.

The battery life is much longer than I expected and probably does approach 40 hrs like the product description says. They came fully charged and I first used them on a Monday and think I probably didn't actually turn them off but the battery still had juice when I picked them back up on Wednesday. They are a little heavier than I expected, but still very comfortable. I am not a musician and can't weigh in on the nuances of sound quality, but I can say that my music sounds phenomenal in these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for Christmas at the behest of my son. Overall sound quality is very good, as is the battery life. Where we ran into problems is when the right side quit working after 9 months. A quick internet search revealed we were not alone with this issue. Apple support was initially happy to send them off for warranty service but quickly denied coverage for a small separation of the left side housing. Seemed trivial but Apple was firm. For $200 I think you can do better. First and last pair of Beats for us.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Been on the market for a while for a good set of Bluetooth headphones and these are by far the best set I've come across that are wireless and reasonably priced with excellent volume, bass and treble, and ease of use! With this type of product u really get what u pay for! At the sale price of $199 it's a great deal! I'm very picky about my music sources and sound quality and these instantly impressed me right out of the box! Highly recommend... It's worth the money...so happy I finally have my own ""Beats by Dre"" headset!❤👍💪💯 Don't sleep on these...super comfy too..can wear for hours without even noticing they're on!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these headphones exactly two years ago today. They now experience random disconnecting and won't repair to an already paired iDevice. At first, these were awesome! The pairing experience with an iDevice is so fluid and seamless. Pairing it to any of your other iCloud-connected devices is so easy. I went from my iPhone to my iPad to my Apple TV all in a day. The battery life is also amazing. I think I went 4 months without charging it at one point. Fast forward to today and I am really disappointed. My Solo 3s started to disconnect in the middle of songs and it wouldn't repair. I tried everything, even resetting the device and forgetting it on my iPhone. That worked at first but that solution would only last a day. I contacted Apple Support and they offered to replace it for $129 plus tax. Now that sounds like a good deal at first, but consider that I already spent $300 on these 2 years ago. I expect these headphones to last at least 5 years. And I took great care of these headphones, they were never exposed to water, and I never worked out with them (they aren't water resistant!). I think I am done with Beats, and instead, I will now take my $129 plus tax and use it towards the purchase of a Bose or Sony headphones. Hopefully, they have better build quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"After purchasing Beats Solo 3's I attempted to buy AppleCare+ at the Apple Store within the 60 day window. Apple informs me that the ""purchase date"" was more than 60 days (in fact is was 120 days prior to my purchase date). Further, trying to get a US representative is nearly impossible. Instead you are placed on hold for more than thirty minutes only to once again being connected to a off-shore representative.

"Not at all worth your $300. Seriously I would not consider purchasing these ever again, especially after the lack of support I received from Apple on them.

I purchased these originally in November of 2017. In June of 2018 I had an issue where audio stopped working completely with one of the ears (I can't remember if it was the right ear or the left ear). I brought them into the Apple Store they looked them over and determined they could be sent in. About 10 days later I received the headphones in the mail, but it was never clear if they were mine or a replacement pair that I got back (if they weren't mine, why did it take so long, why not just give me a new pair right there in the store?).

Fast forward to now, May 2019. I'm having the same exact issue. The audio in the right ear has stopped working. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps they ask you to perform (try on multiple devices, try with the cable connecting it to a device, reset the headphones, etc.). I brought them into the Apple Store, this time I'm told that my only option is to pay $129 for a replacement pair. Apple will sell you a new pair (with only a 90 day warranty) for $129 since you previously purchased this product.

Apparently the original product has a 1 year warranty on it. The replacement/repaired product has a 90 day warranty or whatever is left on your original warranty, whichever one is longer. So at this point I'm outside that window. I connected with Apple Support today, this time online, to go through the same process to see if I could find any other solutions. Same result, I can purchase the replacements for $129 which will only have a 90 day warranty on them.

So two pair of these headphones got me from November 2017 to May 2019, a total of 18 months. I'm not sure how Apple can justify that it's alright for $300 headphones to be completely worthless after a total of 18 months. Considering I had two pair, so they seem to really last roughly 9 months. I will never buy another Beats product again and I'm disappointed that I already own so many other Apple products :(.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Both my beats solo 2 and 3 stopped working between 12-18 moths. Same issue with the right earphone losing hearing without being dropped, mistreated, or abused. The first I assumed was a defect. Having it happen again, I’m convinced it’s designed with a flaw to force upgrades and stimulate purchases. Contacted apple support and after shipping both out at a cost of $130 each to repair, they refused and simply told me to purchase new ones. Poor product and even worse customer service from apple. Bought the Bose qc 3 in the hope that with spending $350, the products quality will mesh with the price better than Beats cheaply made product.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these for my son in May 2018. He LOVED them until the right side quit playing. We contacted Apple since we were within the one year warranty time frame and they informed us that the serial number has been activated in December of 2017, so the warranty was already expired. Without the warranty they want 3/4 of the cost of a new pair to fix. We’re VERY upset that this is how we found out. Apple told us that sometimes other people sell returned items...which makes us out of luck.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I was hesitant to spend so much money on a pair of headphones. I've always just used the headphones that came with my iPhone. Now that the iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack in the phone, I've been looking for wireless ones so I wouldn't have to search for the little adapter. After listening to music with these headphones I realized what a difference quality headphones make. I got the glossy white and they are really pretty (which is a weird thing to say about headphones.) I'm really glad I made the investment :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I believe these are the real thing and the packaging was perfect. They paired up perfect to my ipod but I don't know if they were defective but the volume is pathetic even at full volume... I can barely hear the music but I can hear everything else! Kinda bummed because I had heard some great things about them. They're beautiful and well made but my cheap wire earbuds that I was replacing blow them away... I'm glad I kept my cheap earbuds.

Now I'll go to maybe a Bluetooth earbud or wire system... Just something that has volume so I don't hear all the noise going on when I workout. Just want to hear the music and not what the people next to me are saying. So if you want volume and music when you're working out... You don't want these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Let me start with a couple things. 1) my phone that I use these headphones with is a galaxy note 8. 2) this is my first purchase of any set of headphones that cost more than 40 dollars so high end by my standards.
With that out of the way these are not all I was expecting for such a highly known brand. I have a pair of in ear wireless headphones with what seem to me about the same sound quality and for a tenth of the price. (They are 20 bucks). These are significantly better at noise cancelling which I can appreciate. However some things I have problems with besides the quality of sound is they are tolerable to wear for a period of time with glasses but after that period they can start causing a headache and just be extremely uncomfortable. With that said they do hold secure to my head and don't really move unless I'm moving my head a lot. I've been using them on and off for 3 days now and still haven't charged them (and they came with only a half charge at that) which is incredible to me. The other problem I have is it is extremely catered to Apple I believe. When in Bluetooth mode I had a difficult time connecting even with instructions, the volume up and down/ play pause button is a hit and miss whether it wants to work or not, and trying to go back a song does not work at all. It usually just skips 3 or 4 songs ahead. When it is connected via the wire the button on the wire is useless unless I need to pause and play. The volume buttons do not work and i cannot skip or go back songs. The final problem I had is the case. It is very limited in space which I can appreciate for on the go and packing in my backpack. However getting them into it's case can be much harder than is required.
With that being said, I do actually like these headphones and will keep them. They are a good pair of headphones. The negatives I've included have primarily been the biggest problems that I've run into.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"So i thought i had something wrong with my ears but nope it's the headphones. I've been wearing all kinds of headphones for long periods of time and I've never experienced headphones that would pinch your ears and give you an ear ache that you can't rest your head on the pillow because it's too painful. I've lost sleep, work concentration and money over these. Sound quality is better than other headphones I've used but none of those $40 headphones have ever made me loose sleep. Now I can't return them after using them for one month.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I realize that these are not inexpensive headphones. I wanted really decent headphones that had a really large bass response. Beats are known for their quality and so that's what I was looking for. Fast charging that will last for a long time, meaning that I only seem to need to charge it every few days, and I use it a lot. Also very beautiful. It has invisible controls on one side of the headset, meaning that if you press one of the sides things will happen, like volume control, and most importantly, if push twice it will skip to the next song depending on how you have your source music set. I have mine set to play randomly so I don't know what is playing next. That is controlled by your unit, not the headphones. These are Bluetooth headphones and you can hook them up to anything that Bluetooth's. It also has an incredible range on it. This is my second apartment I have had them at and it actually goes perfectly from floor to floor right through the cement without sound deterioration of any kind. No I don't know what the range is, and so it may depend on your own situation, but I simply do not think that there are better headphones out there for the price. Like I said, if you are looking for excellent bass response, and I like bass, because I listen to a lot of rock 'n roll and heavy metal, then these headphones are the right ones to get. They are also very sturdy and they fold up so if need be you can put them in your coat pocket. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had these since August 2017 and I loved them but I've noticed in the last few months, they don't seem as great. I feel like some songs are fuzzy suddenly and now like tonight, they just keep, for a lack of better word, stopping; the song will stop and I'll check the connection, it is still connected and the song is playing on iTunes, but there is no sound. I'll pause the song, push the little button on the headset, then push play on iTunes and they'll be fine again for a while. And then some nights I can't get them to work at all.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"So the first thing to know about Beats is that they are optimized/equalized before you buy them. You cannot equalize Beats. That's their whole selling point is that you dont need to. Now having said that the question must be asked ""is this a good thing?"" And the answer is, to some degree at least, yes. These headphones are extremely well made and durable and the sound quality is by far the best I've heard yet. The battery life is insane. They advertise a 40 hour battery life at a full charge and up to 3 hours of battery life with just 5 minutes of charging. As far as I can tell these numbers are lower than the actual battery life as on my first full charge i didnt need to charge them for almost a month all while listening to them 4+ hours a day for at least 5 days a week. The only issue with these headphones is these are really made for rap/hip hop. Now don't get me wrong, I have listened to metal, country, pop, classic rock etc on them and it still sounds extremely good, but hardcore audiophiles may not like the inability to equalize the headphones themselves. All in all these are by far the best headphones I've ever owned and definitely are worth the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones have decent sound quality for 1) bluetooth and 2) casual listening. They are on-the-ear style that come with a 3.5mm cable (for plug-in listening and full audio quality), a nifty carrying case. What I enjoy, however, is the pairing with Apple devices via their W2 chip. I recommend these for people with Apple devices (particularly if you have more than one). If you aren't an Apple user or have a mixed ecosystem, check out Sennheiser's HD series for better options.

As they are ""on-the-ear"" phones, you may experience fatigue after several hours. By that point, giving your ears a break (for any headphones) for a few minutes will be helpful.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Ladies & Gents this Review is best suited for those share the same interest in the following questions.
1) Is it Loud Enough?
Absolutely...., Beats by Dre now uses Apple Tech in their HeadPhone lines, held by Strong Standards giving you quality sound and durability......Read On-->
2) is It Worth the money ?
You pay for what you expect not for what you want... , They are Made for the Every Day User with Great Quality Materials and of Course Performance
3)Gloss Black Vs Black?
These are GlossBlack with look great they really are made of good materials and although it has a beautiful glossy black finish to it , its not that annoying super shiny 'sprinkling gloss'

I owned the previous model the Wired Solo 2's wich I did Enjoined but didn't fill my expectations on Quality ... The Solo 3's changes all that....
With High Quality Output Sound, Long Lasting Battery Life, and made of Great Quality materials you have everything you need in the box and the HeadPhones already come with a full charge ..... I gotta be completely Honest and say I have had them for half a day at the time of this review and wanted to write an informative review on my experience .... the quality of hd sound and battery life for daily use ... some up in One word AMAZING!!!....40 hours of battery life after a single charge or 3 hours after a 5 min. charge ...Great Quality Sound and what looks to be made of great lasting material .... Get!! I like the head phones not to mention how quickly it connects to your iPhone , now I also own an Apple Watch and was always pleased on the seamless experience of the bluetooth connectivity ...the Solo 3's give you the same experience ... giving cordless a new meaning.....

"The Basics -
Build quality: 8/10
Sound quality: 7/10
Comfort: 7/10
Battery: 10/10
Usability: 8/10

I'm going to start with the build quality, which I think is excellent. Everything from the packaging to the ear pads is looks and feels well constructed. The design of the headphones is also very simple, so there is not a lot of variation in texture/materials, which gives the headphones their slick and stylish look. The only thing I wasn't very impressed with was the soft shell carrying case, which is only okay. It's good for keeping the headphones from getting tangled or caught on stuff in a bag or pack but offers very little actual protection.

Sound quality: 7/10
For on-ear headphones, the sound quality is pretty good. But at the price point, there are other headphones you could get that have better sound quality. That being said, these definitely perform well and I enjoy listening to them.

Comfort: 7/10
As with pretty much any on-ear headphone, these do start to get uncomfortable to wear after a while. However, I find that I can wear them a good 2-3 hours before they start to get tiring on my ears. I also find that I rarely use them for that long, as when I'm at work or somewhere I'm sitting, I probably won't be using these. So they're great for traveling, around the yard or house, at school, etc, but probably not a primary headphone.

Battery: 10/10
The battery on these is amazing. I believe the battery is listed for 40 hours of use, and I would say that's about accurate. I have yet to have the battery die,

Usability: 8/10
The power button is small but easy to locate, the headphones connect super fast to my phone (almost instantly), and the play/skip and volume controls are accessible and easy to navigate without any thought.

Overall I've been super happy with these and would recommend them to any looking for a stylish and good sounding pair of school/travel headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are very good headphones, but for the steep price, I was a little disappointed. Main points:

1. SOUND QUALITY: This is the most important part of the experience and this is the downfall of the Solo3. The base is too overwhelming, resulting in an overall muddy sound. I was actually quite surprised at how bass heavy these were the moment I first turned them on. Mid range and tenor sound tight and crisp without flaws, but its simply a bit over weighed by the intense bass. Of course this is a subjective determination...but count me in in the ""this is too much bass"" group.

2. WEAR: These are a bit heavy, more so than an accompanying pair of wired headphones, but the weight in itself is not intrusive. The headphones fit tightly, but after some time the ear pads do slightly pinch my lower earlobes. Its not a deal breaker, but again, I was expecting something engineered flawlessly for comfort for the price.

3. CONNECTIVITY / BATTERY LIFE: Excellent coverage on these for blue tooth. I can walk almost up to 10 meters away in a different room before these start fritzing out. A huge plus is the very long battery life. As I listen to music at work non-stop, I was sick of having to recharge headphones every 5-6 hours or so. I charge these once and they last several days and into the weekend as well sometimes.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I recently re purchase beats solo 3 black hoping for a great experience. Out of the box everything was great and working without any issue. Travel to San Francisco didn’t have any issue. On my return trip back to my home state I experience charging issue with the beats solo 3 headphones where the battery would not take a charge and stayed on red. I tried different cables and used an ac to USB charger still same results. I stop by apple and they would have to send it out for two weeks I was still under 30 day purchase period and had them returned. I waited and purchase another pair recently hoping for a great experience worked great no issues until today. My headphone were charging all night with no issue 5 white lights. Went to the gym notice it was at 3 white light s strange. 1 hours of working out the headphones stop working. Stop by apple they said try to reset and charge again if issue continue they would send it out for service two weeks. Came to the office and attempted to reset and charge my beats solo 3. The unit would not charge pass 1 white light for 2 hours. There seems to be issue with beats solo 3 not sure what it could be but I will wait before purchasing again.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Beats are great when it comes to sound quality, mobility and battery life. The design is beautiful, they fold compactly and come with an aux cable so they can be used plugged in to things such as console controllers, monitors, laptops etc. The connectivity with my iPhone is great and the bluetooth range is impressive ( I was able to leave my phone on one floor of the house and go in to the basement and did not lose connection.) There are two down sides to these headphones however, the somewhat fragile folding system and the clamping weight. Basically you fold the headphones over on to themselves to store them and it seems like you can easily break them this way if you aren't careful. The clamping weight is the pressure these headphones put on your ears while they're on. After anywhere between 20-40 minutes of use, I usually have to take them off and readjust them to ease ear soreness. The heavy clamping weight helps these headphones stay on your ears however while moving around/exercising but unfortunately hurts your ears a lot.

Pros:
- Great mobility
- Great connectivity
- Great sound quality
- Great battery life

Cons:
- Fragile design
- Clamping weight (hurts ears over time)
- Price (if looking for budget headphones or if you don't get them on sale like I did)

"I'm not an audiophile but husband is and currently own real great sounding headphones. I've got this ship n sold by amazon and it's 100% authentic and was able to register. We're not an apple household and I only bought this out of long time curiousity and it's battery life.
Coming from Sony and other high end brands, this beats is not really that special audio wise. The bass is good but it is too bass-y for my liking I find it annoying sometimes. It sounds great in upbeat songs because of heavy bass but too muddy and noisy in mellows. I am more into soul, jazz, classical, pop, country, acoustic, 70s 80s classics and the likes so this isn't my go to headphone. I cannot stand this headphone when it comes to slow songs. When I'm in a mood for some upbeat reggae then this is it.
It's overall nice quality, sound is good, just not $200 let alone 300 good. People saying this is the best in market probably never tried the really good ones out there (and it's okay). Glad I bought this at a deep sale price or I'd be crying by now. My $100 Sony & Bose sounds just as good and even better and clearer on most songs in my list. If we have same taste in music, look for something else, you'll find some with same sound quality but at a significantly lower price. And if you want to buy this, do yourself a favor, buy this on sale coz it's really not worth it's regular price. It's only worth $150 tops and that's already a stretch. If you've never owned expensive headphones and been saving $ to buy one then please look somewhere else: sony, bose, audioTec, bowers, beyerdynamic, sennheiser.
I'm keeping this not because of the sound but for my upcoming long international travel. I needed something that will survive me forever without charging since I'll be in the airport and plane for 2 days. The battery life is aweeesome- best out of all my bluetooth headphones!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are the real deal. Once I turned on the Bluetooth on my phone the Beats Solo software automatically appeared. It seamlessly connected to my Apple Watch as well. The Matte Black comes with grey lettering on top which also indicates that it is real. The sound is nice and crisp, especially with some old school Metallica. The headphones feel extremely comfortable, sturdy and light.

"It might seem harsh to ding the headphones for a software issue, but the reason you're paying a premium on these headphones is for the W1 chip, which makes it integrate better into the Apple ecosystem. If you're on android, there are better quality headphones for the price.

The W1 chip does let switching between apple devices work seamlessly, but the new iOS update (that I understand they have no intention of fixing) makes these completely unusable. I had to dismiss this popup 50 times a day whenever my headphones are near an iOS device. This happens on a device that's currently connected OR NOT. And when it's not, there's not even an option to connect. I have to dismiss this dialog in order to manually connect.

This is not a seamless experience. If I open my phone I want information quickly, I don't want to be reminded that my headphones exist. Do Not Disturb mode doesn't even and this misery.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Amazing headphones, I use them to do transcription and I am able to hear every single word without the strain or difficulties I had with previous headphones. The color is gorgeous and I love that it came with a case, cords and even a clip to put on the bag for when I'm traveling. The soft inner cushions for the ears are superb and very comfortable. I was worried that the white would be difficult to keep clean or would not look good but once I received them I saw that this would not be an issue. Controls on the headset are very easy to use, quick to connect to computer, laptop or cell phone and the sound quality is superb. I am very pleased with these amazing head phones and they truly are worth the splurge.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Overpriced. You can either buy for the beats name or spend half the amount of money and get something equal, if not better quality. These will break easily due to being made of cheap material.

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices.

Love them and the sound quality for the most part; however, the left half of the headphones have completely blown out without warning, so now only the right side is producing sound. Very disappointed in the quality of these for the price that was paid for them. Who wants to listen to music with only sound going into one ear?",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not a headphone expert and maybe I was expecting there to be a live concert in my ears but these haven't wowed me in the slightest. The ear cups are small and can get pretty uncomfortable how they sit on your ears, the sound is just ok. Not bad but like I said, I got just as good of a sound from a less expensive pair and to top it off, they pull my hair out every time I take them off. With everything considered, I wouldn't buy them again. I'm giving them to my kids and whatever happens to them, happens. I should have stayed with my less expensive brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I really wanted these and have owned Beats Solo2 that were great. I had to return this product 3 TIMES!!! So aggravating they do not work like they used to and have failed to the point of my having to return. Lost connections and wouldn't reconnect; I have a new Iphone and it didn't work as stated in pairing; you're supposed to just open them and they automatically put a box popup on your phone where you say connect. Worked once. Then when they failed, I totally reset and went to start over totally, and no popup whatsoever. I am beginning to think Apple has done something to mess these things up since they now own the company. Anyway, cannot recommend them.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"First review, more reviews to come the longer I wear This head set.
Wore them to the gym, they did not shift in any direction while wearing them. I wear glasses, I placed then just below my upper earlobe, no year pain after an hour in the gym.
Sound was great, kept it at 3/4 volume, was just the right level to get going, but low enough to hear if someone was trying to tell me something.
Quality feels good and durable.
I have an Android phone, easy to connect to. I also have a Kindle, also a breeze to connect.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones did not disappoint. There is not one bad thing I can say about them. Great quality. Great sound. I had no problem pairing them to my iPhone and MacBook. And yes, THEY ARE AUTHENTIC. I would suggest avoiding buying them from third party sellers, I believe that is why some people are receiving knockoffs. I would also suggest avoiding buying used Beats. Buy them new if you want to be sure you receive the authentic ones. For some reason the (white and gold) Beats were $30 cheaper when I bought them... they went up in price the day after I purchased them. If you happen to see them for a great deal, don't hesitate to buy them. If you're still worried about getting a knockoff, you can always price match at Best Buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones arrived today. After wearing them off and on throughout the day, I have enjoyed their quality in materials and the sound quality is great. I was worried that they'd be heavy on bass, but they're a good balance. I've listened to several genres of music and even some podcasts and the quality is consistent throughout all areas. My only complaint is that these headphones are not comfortable to wear for extended periods. After 30-45 minutes, they start to hurt becuase they put a decent amount of pressure on my ears. This is kind of a bummer because I bought these to use while doing online classes and school work.
*update*
I was working at my computer while listening to a podcast on these headphones. I had to use the restroom, I was able to walk all the way upstairs and listen to the podcast while doing business without any interruption! The distance on these things is ridiculous!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I'll start by saying I had a hard time finding genuine Beats online, if you search online you quickly learn what to look for. These were a bit less than retail, so I wondered if I'd be getting an authentic pair. It was indeed authentic (Mickey's 90th Anniversary Solo3 Beats).

The headphones are gorgeous, they make me smile. The sound is definitely fantastic. I had heard mixed comments on the Beats sound quality, but I spent this morning switching between the Beats Solo 3 and Bose QC35 and I honestly prefer the Beats sound quality. Of course, the QC 35 have perfect noise cancellation, but the Beats never claim to be noise-cancelling.

My only complain about the Solo 3 is that they are on-ear as opposed to over the ear. This means the cushions rest directly on top of your ears and I found that they became a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours of continuous use. I don't know if I'll get used to it, or the cushions will soften/adapt more to my ears. But for prolonged listening, right now, I would prefer an over-the-ear pair.

I'm overall happy with the purchase and I think most people will be too.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"As you can see I have a variety of different pairs and these are the best sounding, most comfortable pair I own. Synced easily with my iPhone, and work perfect with my Series 1 Apple Watch music controller. I wasn't worried about the sync being an issue. They are so comfy even with my 3/4 size gauges, with them being metal it doesn't push them into my neck like some headsets do. They don't slip around either. They cover my entire ear and make a nice ""seal"" I guess you could say. Literally if they are turned up even to half the max volume I can't hear anything around me. Definitely would recommend them to anyone. I got them when they were $179 had some gift cards and such so I got a great deal on them, Amazon definitely has the best prices on these keep and eye on it if you aren't looking to drop the $300.

"Love these headphones. Great sound and easy to connect. Battery life is also exceptional. After having to replace many cheaper brands after a few months, I decided to test out these. I have had them only a month so I cannot speak to longevity but will update if that is a problem. I did notice that, with the first two usages, my phone dropped the bluetooth connect after about one hour (mistakenly thought the battery died) but that has not since happened.",5.0 out of 5 stars

UPDATE- My Beats broke within a couple months internally when I just unfolded them like normal and one side doenst produce sound. I am very dissapointed because I love these things, but for $300 and they break within a year and cost half the price to repair, I reccomend to get a pair of B&o's or Bose headphone cause the sound quality is way better. If you just follow mainstream in tech, youll probably considering getting a pair of these, but they are only ok sound quality for $300 and are like getting Supreme, you get it because it has that ""b"" and ""Beats"" on it.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Obsessed!! After paying full price for these as a gift for my spouse last holiday season and listening to him brag about how awesome they were, i saw the same beats solo3 on sale during prime day. These live up to the hype, especially for less than $150! I’d been using a cheaper (yet prettier) set of over the ear headphones but they would start to feel tight after a bit, didn’t have wireless/Bluetooth option, and the sound was tinny. Now i totally get the big deal about these! They’re light weight, simple to use, the sound is AMAZING, they blocked out ambient noise like a BOSS, and are so so comfortable. Feels like pillows on your ears. Highly recommend. My hubby has used them almost daily to work out in (read: sweat like crazy) and for travel and they last!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Munson bought with his money this headphones. I have use them to test, the sound is pretty good but I don’t like the fit, they feel too tight on my head and the ear caps feel to little. They are not the big ear cover like other ones I’ve seen. I guess they are different styles I’m just saying I like the bigger ones that cover your entire ear.
I couldn’t wear it for more than 15 minutes because of the pressure on my head.

"I have had these headphones for about a year. I love them. However, the leather is coming off the head phones after a little over 12 months. Hard to justify a $300 purchase when they fall apart. After googling the issue it seems like a common issue. I contacted apple and they will not do anything to help me other than offer me a replacement for $150. If that is the case, I would rather buy another brand that will hold up. It is great the sound quality and battery life is fantastic, but if they are falling apart like this, how am I supposed to use them. Seems like a bad design. I suggest googling the issue before you buy.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros
Amazing 40-hour battery life
Good, clear sound on iphone7 from all audio sources (music & other audio playback apps such as YouTube)
Decent call quality for user and caller (unsure of performance in noisy backgrounds or windy conditions)
Good volume range for audio playback and phone calls
Decent noise canceling ability without integration of electronic noise canceling technology (I think ear cups are manually designed for optimum noise canceling)
Cord with high-quality mic provided with headset
USB charging fcable included (able to use iPhone wall charger or other compatible USB wall charger to charge headset as well as charging from connection to PC)
Only 2 hours charging time for full battery life
Comfortable ear cup padding
Headset controls not flimsy and easy to operate
Unbroken long-range Bluetooth connectivity using iphone7
Steller support for software updates, Bluetooth connectivity, and support questions (Beats products are owned and supported by Apple company)
Easy setup and installation with iphone7 (unsure of performance with Mac or Windows PC)

Cons
Some notable trouble using headset to answer mobile calls as well as soft phone calls (skype, what's app, etc.)
Very tight fit (tight squeeze on head causing frequent headaches, though diminished a slight bit after frequent use)
No voice feedback when operating controls (battery life can only be determined by viewing indicator LEDS; troublesome for blind user)
Strangely, no headset battery indicator on iphone7 status bar (many other bluetooth headsets show battery status next to Bluetooth indicator on iPhone status bar)

Well, as you can see, I've experienced a mixed bag of positive and negatives in using this headset. Here are some additional observations based on my experience.

* Though I'm not an experienced audiofile, the bass seems full without distorting other sounds. I experienced enjoyable audio quality when watching TV apps, youtube videos, and listening to music.
* My main purpose for trying this headset was for phone call quality by comparing them with the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series. I did experience fairly clear feedback from callers when using the headset, but callers sometimes reported a bit of distortion from my end but it was only slight. Additionally, I had frequent occurrences where, after receiving a call, I could not answer with the headset when trying to use them to answer the call. Instead, the call was routed to the iPhone itself and I had to manually route the call to the headset.

An Interesting Experience to Note

However, the strangest anomaly occurred when using this headset. From reading reviews and talking with Apple support, I was told, definitively, that this headset does not have a built-in mic when being used wirelessly (accompanying cord does have built-in mic). However, I successfully used the headset using Bluetooth connection (not with cord) and callers could hear me with no trouble. So, I reasoned that if this Beats headset doesn't have a built-in mic, then my iphone7's mic is being used to communicate with callers. However, after moving over 100ft. from my iPhone, the callers could hear me as clearly as when I was less than 5ft. away from the iPhone. So, I really don't know how my voice is being transmitted to callers when I'm communicating wirelessly with this headset. hmmm!

* In addition to trouble in answering calls with this headset, my main beef with this Beats product is the really tight squeeze on my head. Unfortunately, this tightness was quite uncomfortable to the point where I dealt with several headaches. Though I've only had these for 3 weeks, the discomfort has only diminished slightly.

Frankly, because I find the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series to have superior call quality on both ends and to be much more comfortable than these, I will most likely return this headset though it consists of many good features such as seamless connectivity with the iPhone and amazingly high battery life.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"We got these on Black Friday which made them an excellent value. Overall, these headphones are very comfortable and above average from a sound quality standpoint. There are many cheaper options out there, many of which I have tried, but I think that these are really a step up. The other great thing about these was the iphone bluetooth integration which makes pairing very easy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
My first pair lasted less than a year before they started giving problems. Battery life started decreasing. Then the led on/off light wouldn't turn off so it began draining the battery. So sent it in to be repaired thru warranty company. Well they sent it back in worse condition. Headphones went dead after 3 days and would not recharge. I also found damage on the right earpiece that looks like it was preyed open with a flat head screwdriver. So I informed warranty company again and then called amazon. The rep from amazon was really cool. Said not to worry we are sending you a brand new pair instead. Love how amazon takes care of the problem better than aftermarket warranty company.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased the Beats for my daughter and she loves them. This is the second set of Solo3's I've purchased for her. The left speaker failed on each pair. I've done research on the internet and learned that Beats has a problem with the left speaker failing due to a small wire being pinched during production. Unknown if this is the problem with the Beats I've purchased. The second pair I sent back for repair and am still waiting for them to be returned. Apple/Beats needs to address this problem immediately. Amazon has been great with their fast response to assisting us with sending them back for repair, however we were told ten days. It's been longer than that. Thanks",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are...petite, I guess would describe it. They're on-ear, and even when extended fully the headband clamps them on to your head with a tenacity worthy of something from the first Alien movie. My ears can't take more than about 20 minutes before the aching and lack of blood circulation force me to take them off. Haven't encountered this with other on-ear headphones before - the first step in using headphones is actually leaving them on your head, and when that's not really possible, all other considerations pale in significance.

That said, the sound quality is OK, but not great. These sound better than previous Beats headphones, so Beats is definitely improving, but for the price, there are better sounding headphones. These headphones don't overemphasize bass as much as older Beats headphones did, but it's still a bass-heavy headphone. If you want to hear treble and mid-range, there are cheaper headphones that will deliver them more effectively.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a replacement my cheap $25 bluetooth headphones. What a world of difference. Every genre of music sounds fantastic. They are a bit heavy but you get used to the weight. The controls are on the side of the headphones and are easy to use. They pair very easily with Apple products and even with Android products. I found there was a bit of delay with the signal for Kindle HD 10 but I had that same problem with my old headphones. However, the trouble didn't last long. I wore the headphones on a long 2 mile walk and although my ears got warm they did not sweat profusely. I wouldn't use them for a hard workout though. I wish the ear cups were a bit bigger because while I was walking there was a bit of pressure on my ears. They are great for sitting at home and even some light housework. The range is decent but the signal will start to break up around 500 feet away. I would recommend an arm band for your phone or mp3 device if you would like to walk around the house with them and still have good signal. They reduce a lot of exterior noise so they could be good on an airplane or library.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Purchased these head phones under 2 years ago. They are in great condition. Very little use of the past 2 years. They stopped taking a charge months ago. Finally got around to contacting Apple support about the issue. The one year limited warranty did help Apple would not replace the defective Beats Solo headset. Very disappointed with their service and not willing to stand behind their products. Recently my son had a issue with wireless Bose headset. The covering came off due to wear. They too were about 2 years old and out of warranty. Bose support send him a shipping label and replaced the headset free of charge. I'm a Bose customer for life.

"I’m primarily comparing the beats I own to DNA monster headphones I purchased at sharper image. DNA put the beats to shame in sound quality, the quality of materials is equivalent, whereas the beats win in terms of battery.

Here is the problem; why in the world would beats be so popular if their sound quality lacks severely? My answer: Dre, and the fact that they are just cool and come in rose gold (in my case). The battery typically does last a Day, which I gotta say I love. The fact that they auto pair nicely with my phone is great too. I would recommend over-ear beats if you just have to spend the money tho, on ears do get uncomfortable. If I could do it over again, I would have lefts these overpriced headphones on the shelf.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I’ll get to the point.

Pros:

- Noise cancellation is superb. Nothing should disturb your music sessions with these on.

- Bass is adequate. Not earth shattering but good enough for a former bass head who had 10 inch subwoofers in my old Acura :-)

- Battery life is great. Didn’t have to charge these things for days.

CONS:

- Decibels could be louder. I tried these at max volume on all of my devices and was disappointed. Max volume should have your ears ringing but not the case here.

- mid range cords and vocals are lacking.

- The case requires effort to get the headphones inside. It should be effortless.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I have no complaints! Came in original box with everything as described. I’m not a headphone connoisseur and haven’t owned any others comparable to these so I can’t speak to how they measure up to others. I had been told they were of good quality so I got them, and I have enjoyed them so far. Easy to set up, and the charge lasts a long while. If you wear them for hours on end, your ears do get kind of sore, but i would expect that for any type of headphone like this. Does a pretty good job blocking out surrounding noise. We shall see if they stand up against the test of time and are worth the cost.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these for my daughters birthday. I gave them to her yesterday. I ordered them on Amazon Prime day so the window for returning was August 18th. I assumed ( hoped) they would work directly out of the box. My daughter was so excited to get these and they don't work! One side of the headphones is silent. I am SO DISAPPOINTED and am wondering if perhaps they sent out faulty ones on Amazon Prime Day?

I have 2 pair of these and both stopped working via bluetooth after about a year. If you google beats stop working in 1 ear you will see all kinds of reviews.

"I had this unit for more than a month before returning it. Right off the bat, I didn’t like the controls being on the left side. Most people are right handed. Why put the controls on the left? Not only that but the functional layout of the controls were a little confusing. The power button (located on the right, go figure) was so tiny. I couldn’t locate the stupid thing after I had already put the headphones on. I felt like I was reading braille. I could not adjust it comfortably on my head, especially in the gym, in a good position w/o it falling every so often. I’d like to think I have a normal size head. On the plus side, the range (at least 60 ft.) and battery life (with 2/3 hrs of use per day could last a week w/o charging) was excellent.

The headphones are amazing to tune out from your surroundings and just jam out to whatever you like and not worry about missing a call or taking out your phone to adjust the volume or pausing your music or video. Everything is there on the left side phone to make your life easier. My only problem with these headphones is the On the ear design, Your better off getting Studio 3's if you're looking for comfortability while wearing these. Over long periods of time they start to hurt your ear and for instance, let's say you are laying in bed, u can't necessarily wear them while laying on your side, the only position u can wear them in bed is to face up. either way, these headphones are good, the only downside is to how long you can endure their uncomfortability that's all.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I’ve been rocking old school wired Bose QC’s for years (and never write product reviews). As a frequent traveler I rely heavily on my Bose Noise Cancelling “capabilities” - not something these Beats really have. That said, I paid $130 for this lil set-up on Prime Day - fantastic deal. A “whole” day into wearing them and I’ve got to say it just may have been the best $130 I’ve ever spent (heck, they could fall apart tomorrow for all I know). First, I’m really kicking myself in the butt for not going wireless sooner - I’m always snagging the wires on something and popping the wire plum out). Wireless is so liberating!!! The range on these things is incredible. I’ve got a pretty big house and I haven't found a reasonable area where the signal poops out (w/o curling up in a closet upstairs w/ my ipad in the garage). Second, the sound - crisp, clear and plenty loud. I’ve not taken them off since getting them - No doubt that’s going to agitate my wife:). Admittedly I’ve always been a Bose fanboy (not an audiophile though) and dismissed Beats all together as “just another shiny object w/ a great marketing angle”. My kids of course only wear Beats and tell me how much of an old man I look like with my wired Bose phones. Finally, battery life “if as advertised”. I’ve got about 12 hours on these guys so far which already impresses me:). The only “Cons” (it applies to most on-ear phones) are Noise in - they're not Noise Cancelling nor are they advertised to be / and Noise out - I’ve been listening to these things a fair bit louder than I do with my other headphones - when I take them off I notice how loud they are potentially to those around me (going to need to keep the volume at a reasonable setting I suppose). These things rock though - I keep finding myself dancing around the house and I’m no dancer. Get a pair, you wont regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Hoping it’s covered. I was skeptical about buying something like this on amazon.

Half the time, I don't even put on music, I just ""activate"" the super power of noise cancelling and it's like magic. I do use them while at work and even after I've had them on for hours, they're still comfortable.

I tried all the different methods on their site and what others suggested doing, but nothing worked. I contacted beats support and they said I was out of the limited service warranty period so I would need to pay $129 to have them fixed or replaced.

I bought my first pair at $200+ and the second pair at $150 and now they want another $129 to fix a problem that seems to be an ongoing issue with their product due to poor construction. Aside from that, they sound good, which is why I feel inclined to give 2 stars, but based on my experience with these headphones that’s as much as I’m willing to rate it due to poor construction and warranty services.

If you’re going to buys these make sure to get an extended warranty or purchase them at Apple with AppleCare.",2.0 out of 5 stars
My son got these for his birthday. He loves them so much! He always has them on his head and loves the wireless feature. He can have his phone at one end of the house and go all the way to the other end of the house and it is still connected. He had an issue setting it up. You hit the button for 1 second for apple phones and 5 for android. The battery last a long time. He normally charges it at night but it last all day and isn't dead at night when he goes to charge it. The sound is incredible and it is so soft and light weight on the ears and head. I would defiantly recommend these to anyone or any age that loves listening to music or watching movies on tablets/phones.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The reason why I'm giving 3 stars is because the Apple support is great and they are arranging to give me a repaired unit soon, the sound quality is really good as well, and the battery life is crazy long.
I have used these headphone really not even 6 months of regular usage, I have not really over used them, I mainly had them on the pouch, but still, in less than a year they ended up looking like in the pictures below.
I am not sure at this point if this was faulty unit from the manufacturer or who knows what.
I never dropped the headphones, never use them while on the gym, to be in contact with water, but still.
The product on the sound aspect, has an amazing texture of base, lows, it really makes you immerse on the sound itself, I just wish this wouldn't happen. Hope this helps, as many other experiences might not be the same as mine.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought this back in July I got the matt black. When I open the Box it came with beats charger cable and small pouch accessories and it was already charged, it was so easy to connect to my phone and took hours later to died on me. charged again took it to the gym and it was perfect the wireless comes in handy I can answer the phone and talk perfectly would definitely recommend I will be buying more for Christmas for my husband and teen son.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I love mine so much I decided to buy our daughter a set for Christmas. Iv used them for a couple of years. The sound is perfect pitch. They're easy hook up and use each and every time you use them. My favor time to use them are on a airplane flight. My ears just cant take offs or landings. I put them on and it help tremendously my ears dont plug up anymore or painful on flights. I highly reamend these.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I had to say I took a huge risk lol i saw a bunch of negative comments I was like should I get them or not. I don’t know about the other customers, but I got my Beats and I am happy with them. Real deal not Fake atleast mines were real and I got the satin gold and not “Jason’s” old headphones or bose whatever brand that headphones are. Just take care of them. I feel like most of the picture up there are for attention. None of them did an unboxing video from the beginning, its a bunch of photos. Anyone can say its fake. I will tell you this if it did not have shrink wrap on it send it back. I got new ones my cords and Accessories were in the box my beat sticker it look like it was straight from apple.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love these headphones. I lift with them or ride my bike (not always safe, since they are noise cancelling). I love the ability of being able to zone out and listen to music.

They also bring a wire in case your rechargeable battery runs out of juice.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I generally like Beats headsets. The sound quality is great and they are elegantly constructed. This is the second Beats product I bought. The first one (Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphone) broke at the hinge after two years of daily, but careful use. I replaced them with the Beats Solo3, but they lasted exactly a year and six months before one of the speakers became intermittent and eventually stopped working completely.

Beats headsets are expensive. I don't mind paying for quality, but I this will be the last Beats headset I purchase.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I won’t buy Beats merchandise ever again. The power button to operate the wireless function on these headphones quit working within a year and a few months of purchasing. Amazon would not stand behind a replacement.
I was told to call the 800 number for Beats, and they were not helpful either. They will not replace since the headphones are only 5 months past warranty. They should last longer than 12 months because they are not an inexpensive pair of headphones. Very disappointing. Don't purchase this product unless you want to lose over $200.00.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased two pairs of these as a Deal of the Day, but they are really just a Trick of the Day. Of course I saved them for a Christmas gift, months past and I never knew it was faulty. I gift one to my son, and the other to my 14 year old nephew. He was so excited .... but d*** only one side worked. I mean you want to look cool as a teenager but only one side?? What a waste of money. Its like they almost know in advance that you'll be stupid enough to hide these away long enough that the super short 30 day return period passes. And don't bother calling about how they don't work. They will just tell you that they can't help you or to call the manufacturer. Likely as not these are second rate and thus the deal. Remeber that in life nothing is this good; unless its broke.

So it will stare at you from its crisp looking box. Just not working... and you threw your $$ at it. Like a sucker.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Everyone. Please do not buy any product from Beats. All beats products are made from China from really cheap materials and other things in the making of the product. So they are sold here in the U.S for an exaggerated high amount price, and it’s a big profit for the Beats company. Don’t fall into just the brand and it’s marketing strategies. Would you rather look for well-known brand or for quality headphones, proven to work and perform outstandingly? And these other outstanding products are even cheaper than Beats. Why, because the price for Beats is an unreasonable price. The Beats are not worth that price because it’s made with cheap materials. Always research first and read reviews. I was actually in Best Buy today and they told me that Beats are the worst earphones you can buy because of how cheap they’re made. Best Buy themselves even have countless statistics and proofs that the earphone they sell are legit and actually work.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Product was offered at the best price around, prime shipping, etc....no reason to be skeptical when purchasing. The product shows up as a used returned - I pulled a long blonde hair out of the earpiece. 1/8"" phone wire has black streaks on it. I paid for a brand new product and what arrived clearly had been ""test driven.""",1.0 out of 5 stars
"These earphones are wonderful! Bought them for my husband for fathers day, they arrived perfectly in time. He looooves them. They’re easy to connect via blutooth to his phone, ipad and our TV. Battery lasts hours so they last a day-long trip. They’re great at cancelling outside noises so he can listen to an audiobook on a plane without getting interrupted, away from the hubbub. They are pricy but quality is beyond expected. This is the first paur of beats we buy but probably won’t be the last.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought used, but inspected, and the right side only had SOME static/sound that I could hear at top volume. Started return process and agent said he notified some dept & Beats regarding the problem, so...hopefully...this pair of headphones doesnt get sold to yet another customer. BE CAREFUL WITH USED ITEMS EVEN SOLD BY AMAZON! Headphones failed to pair to an Android phone. Phone didnt recognize them. They might work after charging, but I didnt risk it due to the cost.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Had a pair of Beats a few years ago and loved them. Bought these on Prime day for half off and as usual are my favority headphones once again. Very long battery and overall great sound. I also have Bose headphones and these are far superior in sound and quality in my opinion. I also like low end in music being a drummer.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Earpieces are falling apart. This was an absolutely joke of a product to buy. They're not being worn for working out or any activity that would warrant the earpieces to fall off of the headphone. Prior to this, the leather around the earphone was coming off, like many other reviews stated. BE AWARE, this is either an absolutely fake product, or beats are some crappy headphones. More than likely the former. DO NOT BUY! Please! Save yourself the headache.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"These were what one of my grandsons wanted for his birthday. I had no idea if they really were worth the money, but he was ecstatic when he opened them, as were the other grandsons. I listened through them and it was a great quality of music and sound cancellation. I've no idea of the battery life as I've not asked him. He still loves his headphones and Nana and Papa gained big points in gift giving with these. Hah.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Got these for Mothers day last year. Started wearing them in January on a daily basis. They only lasted 4 months and then they would no longer turn on. Said theynm had a full charge but would never turn on again. Waited a few days and kept trying them. Called Apple to have them repaired and got nothing but horrible customer service. Apple just lost another fan. If they can't stand behind their products or at least build something that works longer than 4 months, they are no better than their Chinese Knock-offs. My husband bought a similar wireless pair on Amazon for $29 and they sound the same but have lasted him the entire time he has owned them with no issue. He just ordered me a pair. Could have bought 8 pair for the price of these crappy beats.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Not a knockoff.
These are the best sounding pair of headphones I’ve ever owned, and the decision to purchase was not taken lightly because of the cost. Sound quality is amazing. I’m hearing lyrics I’ve never heard before.

The ONLY downside to these is comfort. They’re fine if I’m wearing them for only an hour at a time, but any longer than that and my ears start to hurt because of the pressure. It almost makes me want to consider saving up for a pair of over-the-ear Studios.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I take care of all the electronics I own. I've gone through maybe ten or fifteen pairs of earbuds so far. These beats aren't those earbuds, and they aren't like many headsets

This is a stupidly comfortable over ear headset with the sound and design to match its Apple product cost. It has lasted me seven months without any sign of trouble. It is sturdy, easily collapsible, and a fast charge for the one or two week charge you could get out of it, even with playing music everyday. Its bluetooth connection is crystal clear and easy to configure most of the time.

However, I am a six foot adult male with a big head. I should've gone with the Beats Studio 3 since its a much larger design for a little bit more money. I don't even remember how I broke the bands on the sided of the headset, though I'm keeping them together via tape. The cost to repair the headset IN APPLE STORE STYLE costs as much as the headset, which is ridiculous. Thankfully, my beats are still fully functioning, and I plan on buying another headset when I have the money.",4.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are great if you can get them to connect to your iPhone. It takes about 15-30 minutes every time you want to get them to connect to your Bluetooth. I’ve tried everything. My headphones power button will be flashing and my iPhone will be searching and nothing happens. You just have to keep powering off the headphones and turn them back on to flashing or keep shutting your phone off and turning it back on. The 15th time of doing a combination of those things will eventually work and it will connect.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"I like these headphones because they look nice and the sound is pretty good. Unfortunately, after about an hour of wearing them, they start to hurt my ears and the sides of my head. Also the cable works for audio but the mic didn't work. I thought ""no biggie"" and ordered another cord but it was the same issue. Unlikely to buy again.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"These are the worst overpriced headphones ever!! They will not sync with my devices, which is my main complaint. The device name is a bunch of lower case “j”. I think these were factory reconditioned. I rarely write reviews but, this is the third product I’ve purchased recently from AMAZON and had nothing but problems with!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Love the product however it had to be replaced because it would not charge correctly. Luckily the year warranty covered it. This is the second pair I have had. The first pair has one headphone that no longer works and it wasn’t under warranty so I am stuck paying $150.00 to get it fixed. Therefore I bought a extended warranty for the the current pair. After paying over $300 for each pair I think they should last longer without having functional issues!,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I work with a lot of virtual conference calls. I had a Jabra provided through work, but couldn't pass up the prime day deal. The wireless microphone in the headset is fantastic. Very important to mute as it will pick up quite a bit.

Connects with ease to all my devices--iphone, bluetooth dongle on desktop pc, work lenovo laptop.

I seem to only have to charge once per week. I was torn between this set and a bose set. I don't regret my choice.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I wish i wouldve just bought these at the store brand new instead of on here. Headphones are not new!!! Ive had them barely over a month and they wont stay charged for the bluetooth and now the sound is going out. I've only worn these probably a handful of times.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I got these headphones to replace a Phillips brand that more than exceeded my expectations for the price I paid. I chose Beats brand because of their quality reputation and was really excited for their noise cancellation ability. While the unboxing was impressive and I enjoyed a full charge at arrival, these offer absolutely no noise cancellation as advertised. I bought two pair: one for myself and one for my kiddo. For the price I paid, I am extremely disappointed.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased these to finally go wireless with less ports on my work machine than before and I got to use these for about 6 months before they stopped charging completely, rendering them useless as wireless headphones.

They’re very pretty, and the folding aspect with the case is clever. The wire for using them as wired is nice but, if I wanted wired headphones I wouldn’t have paid an extra $100 for these.

Additionally, it’s worth noting that you should be aware of the size of your head. I wear glasses and found these very uncomfortable to wear after an hour or two because they pushed the arms of the glasses into the sides of my head. I could get around it by pushing the arms of my glasses over the ear cushion but this obviously messed with my astigmatism prescription.

The charging problem is not a one-off thing. Do a web search and see that many people have needed to fix this and it involves cutting open the headphone to rewrite it yourself.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these because they were on sale for $140 that day. That’s a decent price for them. I wouldn’t pay much more though. They are a little tight and pinch my ears after awhile—my head is not huge.

NOTE: the studio version has noise cancellation, the solo version does not. I bought these bc they were cheaper and the noise cancellation function gives me motion sickness.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"My fiancé gifted these to me for Christmas to replace my old Beats which were not wireless.

I love these so much! The color is beautiful and actually matches my hair. Sometimes my family tries talking to me not realizing I can’t hear.

The battery has up to 40 hours and it really does feel like it lasts forever. I can’t wait till I travel again because they are going to be amazing to use.

I highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones were terrible! When the box arrived, it was not completely sealed. It looked as if it had been previously opened. Also, the zipper to the carrying case that comes with it was broken.

After using it only 4 times, and within the first week of owning them, the material broke away from the plastic on the right side air phones as shown in the picture. Also, the headphones plastic cracked and split open and the backing to the auxiliary device mic fell off and wouldn’t click back on. I question the authenticity of this product. I feel like I purchased a knock off sent to me in an original box. Not happy. Returning them.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I will admit I am a long-time review lurker, but never actually post reviews here because I'm lazy. However, I felt as if I should give an honest review for these, as the holiday season is approaching.

I'm a HUGE music guy and have had a pair of Beats and every On-Ear model since they first rolled out. My Solo 2 wired in headphones got stolen out of my luggage and I recently got the iPhone 8, so I figured it was finally time to venture into the ""Wireless"" territory. I purchased the Solo 3 Wireless Gloss Black pair back at the end of September and everything came as expected and they looked awesome.

However, after 45 min at the gym and them being fully charged, they just turned off and would not power back on. I tried numerous Youtube videos of resetting them and charging them, but nothing. I chatted with an Apple associate and ended up bringing them in to the Genius Bar and even they were baffled at what was going on. I sent them in for repair and got them back a few days later and after one use the same issue occurred.

I then went to the Apple store again and we looked at everything, software on my phone, the headphones, etc, and they were still baffled. I sent them in again and they sent me a new pair. This new pair worked well, but would not power off (light always flashing) and also would not charge at all. Maybe it was just the Gloss Black style? I don't know.

Finally, after about a month of frustration, I sent them back to Amazon and searched forever on Amazon for a new pair of great wireless headphones (since I used gift cards to buy this), but could not find anything that had the fashion, fit and sound that I liked from my Beats.

As a loyal Beats fan, I insanely purchased a new pair of the regular Black Solo 3 Wirless beats and so far everything has been working amazingly, the sound is awesome, the battery life is insane and they fit perfectly for when I'm going running.

Moral of the story is these headphones are really great, but like they always say, ""third time was a charm"" and the whole process of getting there was a bit frustrating. Therefore, I caution on the side of buying any warranty on these, as all of my costs were taken care of and I didn't spend a penny extra.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm a headphone enthusiast and I love these headphones. I have Sennheiser 600HD's, amped, in ear monitors, in ear Bose headphones, and about 4 other cans.

I would say these are ""Fun"". They don't have a huge sound stage, but you can't expect a huge soundstage from on ear headphones. They sound great for Bluetooth headphones and they feel comfortable.

I originally bought these for use in the gym since I workout 6-7 days a week but honestly I sweat way too much and these only make it worse. If you're a sweater then don't get these on ear headphones, you'll be miserable, you'd probably be better off with the in ear power beats.

I give these 5 stars though because they just sound fantastic. And they have a 40 hour battery life. That's just wild to me. They are the best (or should I say the funnest?) Bluetooth headphones I've tried out so far and I tried out quite a few before buying these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Ok so I’m a really picky person when it comes to headphones, I have gone through jbl, skullcandy, Apple. You get the point, I’ve been through a ton of headphones, but these ones have satisfied me the most. Alright to my review, bass: bass is alright I’d say, enough to satisfy me, not to much not to less, I will be honest when this is at max volume, it will shake your head hard, but if you can’t handle that volume I do not recommend. Sound quality: this is what I love about them the most, their sound quality is litteraly crystal clear. absolutely recommended if you just want to hear every detail of the music and video that you are watching. Comfort: the insides are made of memory foam which is really soft when worn in warm temperatures, which is really good, the top part has padding. but when in a cold temperature it gets really hard and uncomfortable, so if your looking for headphones for a cold climate, I do not recommend these, I have a couple of friends who absolutely destroyed their headphones, like torn the leather from the headphones, but to prevent that, keep it in a case at all times you are not using it, don’t leave it on the floor, on a desk, basically anywhere without its case(provided). Noise cancellation: their is some to no noise cancellation on these headphones, so if your in a loud environment your going to hear it. Noise leakage: I have tested these in a quiet environment and no one will here you, ok if it is at like max they can here it but it’s like a whisper(friend told me). So if your looking to listen to this in like a library, these absolutely for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones were a splurge for me but turned out to be an expensive disappointment. Wireless solo3 right side stopped working after warranty expired. Took great care in keeping these headphones pristine and even bought an additional matching case. Fees to repair start at $130 with $7 shipping just to look at them. Waste of money and won’t be replacing them with Beats. I can buy better ones from other companies for less than the cost to repair or replace.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I reeeeeally wanted to like this. I have another brand already and heard my sister's Beat. I decided to get myself one. The sound quality does not justify the price. It is not far from the $37.00 wireless unit I have, but fine I was going to keep it anyways. Then the biggest obstacle was the functionality. On my headphones, I can easily maneuver back, forth and sound up and down. The Beats did not seem to have the feature. Nothing other than power on and off. I am rather computer savvy but could not make it work. Back to the MPOW unit. It functions better for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First off the connectivity of these is great. I was two floors above my phone and they performed like normal! I am an Apple user so that might be why it's so good. These are super comfortable and they fit my head super well! The battery life is no joke too, I charged them too 93 percent used them the entire day checked the battery and there was still 87 percent left! Once you put these on at about 5 or 6 volume everything else fades out. The controls on these are also super helpful. You can adjust the volume, activate Siri, pause songs (works with Spotify) and pick up and hang up calls, I mean what else could you want. These look super sleek on your head. I recommend the matte black because then they don't take fingerprints and scratches easily. One other thing is the mic. It might just be me but there is a slight echo so you can hear what you are saying. Everyone that I've called says that I sound great! In conclusion, these are a great pair of headphones and they are totally worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These stopped working on one side; the leather started coming off! We
Sent them to Apple to fix; they accused us of third party tampering which did NOT happen and they sent them back in worse condition then they were when we sent them and now they are completely unusable. The warranty needs to be honored! It has not even been a year!",1.0 out of 5 stars
My wife uses these every time she goes to the gym - this is the first pair of expensive headphones that she is actually willing to use. Great battery life and works flawlessly with her iPhone. She is very pleased with the sound quality and it does a great job playing that hideous hip hop crap she listens to. Other reviews are luke-warm on this model but I can't agree with them - it's great value for money.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"it s the first time purchase an on-ear headphones so can not compare with other products. I have it for around 2 months now, sound quality is a bit above average, It has plenty of bass. like other Beats products, quality looks good. The battery life amazed me, 1 hour charge and I use it for 4-5 days, 10hrs/day. The range is pretty far, more than 50 yards I still have good connection. The only thing bothers me is that it hurts my ears after around 1 hour of using. I tried to stretch it by put it over a few book, then use hair dryer to heat it up, leave it over night. It helps quite a lot.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these for my hubby as a graduation present since the ones he had were the wired ones. Gave it to him for graduation and he originally didn't even use them for about a month. So, about 2 months after purchasing them the cover on the ear portion began to come apart. The thread just started to unthread and now you can see the cushion part of the ear. He doesn't even use them anymore. I am very disappointed as these headphones are not cheap and this was his graduation present for getting his Masters!",1.0 out of 5 stars
I got these for a trip and I still love them. They work very well and match my phone. They have a case so I can keep the cord and charger all together. They are adjustable and easy to set up. Noise quality is really great. These are not noise canceling ones but they block out noise well. They turn off in MN cold if you do Bluetooth but work just fine with the cord. There are many color options too.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The biggest quality these headphones have is by far how convenient they are and how easily they connect to an iPhone. They also look very good and the sound quality on these headphones is all right as long as you aren't expecting too much. The controls are also subtle and easy to reach.
However, I cannot recommend this product. The biggest problem with them is how fragile they are. After only six months of casual use, substantial damage is visible. Particularly on the headband, which lacks cushioning and tears very quickly. The other problem is the price. You can find headphones that accomplish the same job for about half the price when looking at brands like Sennheiser or AudioTechnica.
This product seems to be aimed at younger people looking for good looking and convenient headphones. I recommend that you save your money and look elsewhere for headphones that look just as good, sound just as good and are far cheaper.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Birthday present for my 15 year old, he absolutely loves them. I tried them myself and the sound quality is amazing. Couple of quick points:
1. do not have the audio cable plugged in when trying to turn on or setup Bluetooth. The cable needs to be left out in order to do that.
2. if you do use the audio cable, the 90 degree elbow end goes into the audio device and the straight end goes into the headphones. otherwise you will only get sound out of one side.
We had a couple issues initially, but that is only because we didn't follow the above two points. After figuring those out, the headphones work great. Great sound and decent comfort. Easy to setup.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I am constantly wearing headphones and wanted to switch it up by getting a pair of over the ear wireless headphones. I've been looking into getting Beats for a while and was excited to try these out!

1. I love the look of them! Thought I'd look hideous in over the ear wireless headphones but they're super cute and look great.

2. I love the optional cord to plug into devices (not the charger). Provides a nice option if you want to use that!

3. They're kind of comfy. Not the most comfortable I've ever experienced but decent. Maybe it adds to a little discomfort with the fact that I have multiple ear piercings that perhaps are a little smushed with these style of headphones.

4. The sound quality is AWESOME! So great.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"First off let me say that when they are not broken, they are excellent headphones. Sound quality, battery life, range, all of that is great. The problem is they are not durable at all. The first pair I owned, I had to send back to the manufacturer after 6 months due to the battery that all of a sudden stopped charging. It was under warranty so they were replaced. 9 months later the right headphone stopped working but because it was past their 1 year limited warranty (from purchase date) there wasn't anything I could do. I ended up giving them a second chance and buying a second pair, which lasted a little over a year until one side of the headphones (they are expandable) came clean off the headset. For $250 dollars I expect them to last longer than a year. I would suggest going with a different companies product unless you are comfortable replacing these every 12-18 months. All in all its been 28 months since I bought my first pair and now I need to buy a third set of headphones, it will not be from Beats.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Broke after a year. Nothing weird, just wouldn’t turn on one day. Sent them into apple for 130$ for service. After hours of dealing with the service department, they told me I “made product modifications” and they won’t fix them for the 130. These have never left the office. Essentially was accused of being some sort of bedroom hacker with my headphones? Stunningly ridiculous. They told me they’d fix them for $369. Not sure if they’re aware how much they are new? The whole experience is insulting, I won’t be buying more beats products.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I loved this product and gifted it to my wife for her birthday. Its been 5 months and she has barely used these. In the starting she mentioned that it gives her pain in the ear lobes, but i said may be she is not used to headphones so it takes time adjusting. Now she started back and has got a permanent pain in the lobes that hurts her in her day to day activities specifically sleeping as the ears touch he pillow. She has stopped using it now and this product is a waste for me. I want to return it back and need my refund but amazon will not entertain it now. It has created medical issues for my wife and the product is still almost new here. I invested money here and i m really really disappointed with the quality.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Full disclosure. I am an MPow guy that is very satisfied with the quality over my wireless headset. That said, I could not pass up on the deal during Amazon Prime Day. I got this headset for 55% off normal cost and have not been disappointed with my purchase. Very impressed by this headset. Mind you, I was the guy that would never spend $300+ on a pair of premium wireless headphones. At $146 you can't go wrong. ;)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these over three years ago and use mostly for travel and when I'm walking.
Had to take them to get replaced a little over a year ago because they stopped holding a charge and apple replaced when they could not repair. Well now the same thing is happening with the replacement. Couldn't get 2 years out of either head phone and since the one I have is a replacement no further warranty.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Really disappointed. When my wife first used these, running outdoors, they only lasted 5 minutes then shut down. She fully charged and tried again and once again, they stopped working after 5 minutes. Amazon replaced and the new pair is doing the same thing. I thought I was buying top-of-the-line equipment. By the way, the sound is good until they shut down. Honestly, I wouldn't buy these if you live up north where the outdoor temperature falls below 32 degrees.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Great product, until it stops working. 7 months use and no sound out of one side. Ear pads are also ripping away from frame and just look like material is crumbling.
Still under warranty, so we will see the fix they offer. Will update. At this point, not worth the price we paid, wouldn't buy again.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Shockingly poor quality materials and subpar construction for a premium priced product from Beats (and Apple). The sound is solid - although they should get louder in my opinion - but after just a handful of months of ""light use"" they are literally falling apart. There are two places where the adhesive has worn off and the components are separating from each other. Keep in mind, I'm not some punk kid who doesn't care for his stuff, I'm a 40-year-old man who absolutely babies my electronics!",1.0 out of 5 stars
The first Beats Solo3 received did not work. They would not go wireless nor would they fully work while plugged in. They had many issues. Amazon immediately sent a replacement as I packaged and sent the return item. The replacement head phones were as expected and worked great! My son has enjoyed hours of listening time in the few days he has had them. The battery is amazing and he loves the sound and feel of the headphones. A definite recommend.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I like this product very much. I have to say when I saw the packaging it made me realize how high the standards were. The unboxing experience was top notch and couldn’t ask for better. The first thing I notice when I put these headphones on was that the earmuffs were really soft and comfortable. Then I paired these up to my iPhone and I couldn’t even imagine the simplicity apple has created to pair these beats to a device. Next I played some music. It was very high quality and they were better than any of the headphones I’ve had before, the highs and lows were very balanced. And do not worry about these being counterfeit because I was worried when I purchased them but when I paired the beats there was proof of the W1 chip because of the simple pairing. The battery life on this is also remarkable I didn’t have to charge these for weeks till they were dead. Overall I really recommend picking these up, bye and I hope u like your beats. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these Beats headphones because they were on sale, and because I thought ""It's been a while since I had beats, maybe I should give them a second chance."" I should not have. I may be biased since I own high quality headphones, I have Bose QuietComfort 35ii and Sony WH-1000XM3s. I was expecting sound quality maybe just slightly below these with no active noise canceling since they were just on-ear and what I got was far below my expectations.

Sound Quality: 2/5
By no means are these the worse headphones I've ever listened to, but they are the worst headphones I have ever listened to at this price point. The trebles are just meh and that's the best part of these headphones. The mids sound like you're listening to someone else's party down the street or you're listening to someone else's music through a wall. It's atrociously bad and this is the worst part of the headphone. The bass is actually okay... until you have both bass and another range of sound playing at the same time. The bass quality is nice, and these really boost bass but you sacrifice washing out the rest of the song into a muddle mess and hearing nothing but slapping bass. This is fine, if you're a basshead and these headphones are GREAT when I'm listening to a bass-heavy rap song or EDM, but when I want to listen to anything else they're pretty trash.

Appearance: 3/5
These are beats and they look more like a fashion statement than any real headphones. Audiophiles will smirk as you pass by them because they know you paid way more than these are actually worth.

Comfort: 1/5
The clamping force is too hard for anyone to wear comfortably especially compared to what else is on the market for this price point. On top of that the materials used are super uncomfortable. The rubber headband pulls on your hair (and mine's short, I'm in the Marine Corps), the ear cups are stiff and made of some type of pleather probably, and after a half hour of wearing them (ONLY A HALF HOUR!!) I don't want to continue listening to these headphones since they push on my ears uncomfortably, grip my head and pull my hair (I'm not that into BDSM, thank you).

Ease of Access (iOS): 3/5
Ease of Access (everything else): 1/5

Connecting to an iPhone or iPad is a breeze, just turn the headphones on and bam you're connected for the most part. Sometimes it's a little finnicky. In comparison, the airpods have a much smaller form factor, better latency and better range.

Connecting to any other device is like trying to fight your mom; you'll probably win, but is it worth it? Definitely not. These will connect to your other devices, but in order to stop it from connecting to my iPad even when I had told my iPad to forget these headphones I had to take my iPad to another room and turn on these headphones outside with the device I wanted. Definitely cumbersome.

For full price of $299.99 these are just not worth it. Even for the discounted price of $160, they just aren't worth it.
Amazon has plenty of other well-priced headphones on the market...

For bassheads: Skullcandy Crusher Wireless ($120)
For flat EQ but good sound: Bose QuietComfort 35ii ($350)
For the best acoustic sound: Sony WH-1000XM3 ($350)
Best sound on a budget: Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (on sale for $130, but usually $150)

In summary, if you want convenient iOS headphones, just buy the airpods. If this is you're first time venturing into the expensive headphone market, I hope this review helped you move away from these headphones. I really don't know who these are for except people who were previously fans of the Beats line. If anything though, I think their sound quality has further degraded from when Beats was partnered with monster headphones. I hope this review helped!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are AWESOME! As a Mom, I am typically not a “name brand” kind of person. These were a gift from my husband and really a splurge, but I absolutely love them. Doing laundry, dishes, and other housework is much more enjoyable listening to music and these do not fall off my head like other headphones and earbuds I have owned in the past. So any Moms out there who aren’t sure about these, just go ahead and make the purchase. High quality, easy to connect, and well worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"love my headphones and if it gets soiled, I use a wipe or a damp soapy rag to clean it and it is a good as new. It cancels out everything and the battery life is as promised, I listened to my books when I’m cleaning the house, running errands, and doing choirs and I’m never worried that the battery is going to fail me. For how I use it you would think I would have to charge it daily, but I don’t. It’s a great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is my second pair of Beats and both stopped functioning after about 18 months. My last pair would not turn off. I did a factory reset that worked but now it won’t turn on. I’ve tried every trick known to the Internet to no avail. Beats updater says that my firmware is up to date and that my Beats are functioning. Obviously not. On a good note, the battery life and sound quality are both great.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I loved them for everything except for comfort. After less than 30 minutes, I continually had bad ear and jaw pain. I could feel my ears throbbing while wearing them. I tried moving them around and stretching them out to no success, so I'll be returning them.
I'm definitely a believer in everything else about them, so I hope they make future iterations that'll work for me!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I like the sound quality, the lightness, and I’m pleasantly surprised by the comfort level. I have previously owned Beats Solo 2’s Wireless and they did hurt my ears after wearing them awhile. I’ve worn these for hours straight with no issues. The bass is sufficient and the Bluetooth connection with my iPhone is flawless! I’d say these were a great purchase at 129 dollars during the recent Cyber Monday event.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are HORRIBLE! I have gotten 2 different pairs for my fiancé. Both pairs will not hold a charge. When they do charge, the die very quickly. Disconnect from phone for no reason. Cannot even get to turn on anymore when they are fully charged. These are a waste of money and should be fraud for what the represent compare to what they provide to you. Two different pairs have done the same thing. It's the product in general. bad quality. Do not waste your money on these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros:
1- looks amazing
2- Loud sound
3- fair bass

Cons:
1- No Next/Previous track buttons.
2- Ears get too hot at gym because of the leather. I would really prefer if they made another sport line that contains cushion instead.

Concentrate on the performance & comfort. The only difference between Solo 2 & 3 is battery which doesn’t make sense",3.0 out of 5 stars
If you are a bass hunter or like dubstep this is for you otherwise look for better quality headphones low range is non existent or muffled and medium is there but super heavy on bass and the wireless works well but not long range enough the earpads are the same from other models so they will ware out better to buy replacements now or higher quality ones. You are buying the name not good headphones. Decent battery life.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"My nephews wanted these, and they love them. They sound okay to me, but I'd honestly look elsewhere if you want a high-quality, comfortable pair of headphones.

The bluetooth and battery life are the real pluses on these. The battery lasts forever, they charge pretty quickly, and the bluetooth has a really good range. The sound tends to be a bit bass-heavy and possibly muddy, and I don't know how comfortable they would be over a long session. I tried them out only for a few minutes and could only go off of my immediate impressions.

Depending on your genre preferences, these may be suitable. For me, I would look elsewhere.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I went through every process detailed to check whether they were real or not after I got them on a too-good-to-be-true Prime Day deal. From everything I can tell they are, and they register with the Beats Software Updater.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones sound really good like other beats headphones I have had. The problem with these headphones is how uncomfortable they are. If you are only using them for 30 minutes or so they are just fine. Anything more than that your ears will start hurting more and more. I don't know why they went with on ear headphones pads instead of over ear headphones. The studio headphones I have are over ear and they can be worn for hours without any discomfort.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I really enjoy the convenience of these wireless headphones. They're easy to use and fit comfortably over my ears. They're not too heavy, which I was concerned about because I plan to run in them, and the collapsible arms are helpful for storage. In terms of sound quality, I don't feel that they're especially better than other good quality headphones, but they're good. The sound quality certainly isn't compromised at all. Whether intentional or not, they do have some noise cancellation effect also which I appreciate. Overall, pleased with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"The problem with this product is not the quality but the user unfriendliness of it’s design.
You don’t even know if it’s off or on, because there is no signal... either the design is flawed or the product I received is defective.
Having some kind light that indicates it’s on will help... per the user manual it says the fuel gauge will light white... the product I got only shows the lights when it’s only plugged to usb...",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I just ordered and received these headphones today (same day delivery with Prime). I'll start by saying they are authentic Beats (Fulfilled by Amazon). I purchased the protection plan just in case. That being said, i'm listening to music with these headphones as I write this review, and they are perfect.

They'll be gym tested tomorrow, but based on the fit, I don't anticipate any issues. A great first impression.

Build: 4 - Lightweight and sturdy construction
Comfort: 5 - Snug fit...stays on my head, and they fit comfortably
Sound 5 - The sound is great. I'm no audio expert, but it offers deep, rich sounds",5.0 out of 5 stars
My granddaughter loved them. She plays the piano and can hook them up to her keyboard and listen to songs as she plays them back on the piano without bothering the rest of her family. The sound seems to be awesome and it was just the pick of Christmas. I bought a blue pair for her brother and he loves his as well. His were the Solo2 and there is not a lot of difference between the Solo2 or the Solo3...,5.0 out of 5 stars

"Bingo! As an older fella I haven’t been impressed with all the young studs walking around with these but, in desperation, I ordered a pair and have never looked back. I like them.

I’ve had them for a month now and STILL haven’t used the charging cable.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is amazing and I love it, but only use it for less than 2 months and the sound is not playing in the right ear.

I'm very disappointed and sad since I really enjoyed it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I order the headphones thinking they would do me justice on my deployment in Kuwait but I was wrong like way wrong. The first month they were perfect in every aspect of the word but out of nowhere one side went out and would barely work since. Two more months passed and then they just stopped working all together and since the warranty was with a 3rd party it just left me with broken headphones in the middle of my deployment. I will never buy anything like this from amazon again and amazon was my trusted source till now. So be careful what you buy and trust and believe these are trash.,1.0 out of 5 stars
90 days after purchasing the material began to tear away from the head piece. I took it to the Apple store and they replaced them only to have it happen within 90 days again. Warranty is now up and I refuse to order another pair or pay for them to be fixed. The quality does NOT justify the price and I’ll NEVER order another pair.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Power button stopped working after a little over a year, which after some extensive googling seems to be a very common problem with beats headphones. They were decent quality in terms of audio, not completely sound cancelling, but I liked them. If I’m honest I bought them mainly for their battery life and their appearance. Sad to have lost them, which I guess indicates something in their favor. But angry enough not to want to buy them again.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"They sound really good. I haven't tested a bunch of brands, but I know Beats get really good reviews. The only reason I don't give them five stars is this: After about 8 months of use, these wireless headphones are starting to do what my wired Beats did -- the foam is starting to peel away on the ears. It's not the end of the world....I'll probably order some replacements when they come all the way off. But this issue keeps them from being a five-star product.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Was looking to upgrade from my original solo’s and I’m incredibly pleased with the Solo3’s. These headphones are so aesthetically pleasing! I got the Satin Silver color and I am so happy with how crisp they look. These are more comfortable than the original Solos and seem to be constructed in a more solid manner (I threw in a picture of my old white Solos for comparison, which might I add lasted me SEVEN years without trouble, hoping for the same longevity with the Solo3’s). The Solo3’s sound awesome and the pairing capabilities are lightining fast due to the w1 chip that allows for speedy pairing with Apple devices. I will update once I’ve had these headphones for longer to report on their durability and battery life. Extremely happy with my purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I received it and it wasn’t sealed, had greasy finger prints all over the headset, there was a beat up LG charger to replace the original one, the case was missing, and the instructions were missing as well.

These headphones are really nice. The bass isn't too crazy but enough where it doesn't disort it. The sound overall is pretty decent. They connect easy and have impressive battery life. They last about 2 days without disconnecting them once. I would recommend these but make sure you read the specs before you buy if your looking for super loud bass headphones,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I love this headphones, they connect so easy to any device, ipad, TV, phone, and the sound is just amazing. I wanted this headphones because I've been doing binural meditation and I wanted to cancel any noise. I don't like having anything inside my ear and the tiny succion headphones create some king of pressure on my ears, instead of meditating I keep focusing on how my ears feel. I got my headphones on sale and although I wanted another color (whcih was not on sale) they are woth the price!! Best of all is that I can watch tv late without bodering anybody.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Much, much too expensive for what you get. My 11 yr old son insisted on these because of the brand name. The sound quality and build quality aren't nearly as good as what you get for this price from Bose, Sennheiser or Grado. The plastic circle behind the driver pops off every week or two because the plastic tabs holding it together don't fit tight enough. Bluetooth connection is pretty solid to both Apple and Android devices.",2.0 out of 5 stars
I love the headphones in general but have found that after 30 minutes of use and they make my ears hurt. They push against my piercings into my cartilage to be quite sore. I have attempted to get replacement ear cushions in hopes of getting some a little bigger but if you change ear cushions then it voids warranty. They also do not offer replacement ear cushions from beats. So in my case they have not been worth the money I spent on them. I attempted to allow my 11 year old to use them and he states it hurts his ears also. Might be just us might be a issue for others as well. I would go with the studio headphones if you getting them over the ear.,3.0 out of 5 stars

I have had these headphones for almost 2 weeks now and I love them! They are able to connect to all of my devices via bluetooth with no issues and they hold a charge for a long time. I use them for hours on end and haven't had a problem with the battery getting low or dying on me. The sound is also great. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a bit tight on my ears and it starts to hurt after about an hours use. I ordered the gloss black which I feared may look cheap or leave fingerprint marks but it actually looks very nice in person and doesn't get dirty easily.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are awesome for working out in a crowded gym– noise cancelling enough to block out all the other machines without having to turn up my music to dangerously high volumes, big enough to signal “don’t talk to me”, and adjustable so they don’t fall off my head when I’m doing abs or something (a big problem for me, I have a tiny and weird shaped head). Plus, the matte black is very pretty (in my opinion). Plus, the automatic connection from the W1 chip to my iPhone is a MAJOR bonus over the older models; otherwise, I can’t tell much of a difference from my old Solo2s. If you don’t have an iPhone, maybe save your money and go for an older model, but if you do, then the W1 is an amazing investment. Overall, I love em!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great sound, comfortable headphones and great price! All wireless! Great color and was waiting to get these when I could afford it, but these are $110 less than I have seen elsewhere so became my birthday present to myself! Convenient with a carry case. I would have made the zipper on the carry case open wider, but that is my only complaint. Even has a carabiner to snap it on something for safe traveling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought as a gift and my husband LOVES them! He likes to listen to house music so the bass is a huge deal. He could not stop talking about how incredible they are. While not deafeningly loud to the wearer, people around can hear the music. So I wouldn't recommend wearing them at a high volume in a library or someplace where you need to be quiet. The sound quality is superb though.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Very very VERY disappointed! After less than 6 months of using them (and I bought two pairs!) both are:

- Going away and coming back sound quality
- Need to be charged for over 24hrs to work for 2hrs straight
- Disconnecting in the middle of work online meetings and webinars
- Currently, both pairs are NOT WORKING!!!

I am utterly disappointed, upset and I would never EVER recommend this product!

"Liked them, sound was good, but they crapped out. No power. No lights. Charge was good while it lasted. Bought a new battery, but it didn’t fix them.

"So, everything came great and it was good quality. I just got a headache from wearing them because it was too tight on my head and the pressure changed in my ears.

"I'm a huge Disney nut & wanted these soooo bad but didn't want to pay $300. So when they finally went on sale during Black Friday deals, I was super excited!! At first they great & then after about an hour, they became really uncomfortable on my ears. It felt as though they were clamping my ears down to my head like a vice grip. I tried adjusting them, taking out my earrings or just moving them around in general. The only thing that helped was taking them off. I was so disappointed and had no choice but to return them. They were no good to me if I couldn't wear them for more than an hour at a time.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Battery power is phenomenal.
Two weeks without charging. Everyday use. The only down fall is the case in which the headphones come.

Worth the price for the quality and duration of battery!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I recommend these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Can’t say enough about the battery life. Bought them for my 12 year old who consistently is hooked up to wired headphones. He uses them for hours during the day and hasn’t had to charge them in 3 weeks. They still have 53% battery life left. Specifications say 70hr battery life but I really didn’t expect it. Only downfall is, the case provided with them is a soft case and not very protective so I would definitely consider spending an additional $10 on a hard case for them.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I loved mine while they lasted. Now only one side works when I connect it through bluetooth. The head pad that it has is going to come off really fast after you use them for a couple of months.

I travel a ton for work and rely on headphones that will reduce the white noise of the planes engines when attempting to watch movies/shows or listen to music. These headphones were great at achieving that and super great in instantly connecting with my apple products.

"Headphones worked fine until sliding function broke. We used tape to hold it in place. Sent the product in and they refused to honor the warranty because applying tape was an ""unauthorized modification"". The tech couldn't care less and I've heard this is commonplace for Apple. They have your money...and guess what...they will gladly send you a new pair at ""market value"" which is currently $40 more than I paid for them. They broke within 2 months of ownership. Guess my son will have no headphones for his virtual school he is forced to attend. Thanks Apple for your compassion and commitment to reliability!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was very hesitant on buying Beats because normally they're heavy on the bass and muffled on the treble. Not with the Solo3. These were extremely well rounded in the Bass/ Treble. Don't get me wrong, these headphones have a lotta Bass at a high volume and the treble is adjusted acoustically to sound normal and not muffled. At a low volume, the treble jumps out at you with a crystal clear sound and the bass is adjusted to a low roar.

The weight is pretty well distributed. They sit pretty well on your head with no extreme tightness on the ears or the head. Yes, they sit on the ears instead of over the ears. I didn't realize this until I received them. I have used some like this in the past and didn't care for the feel or the sound of them. Once I tried on the Solo3, I could tell this wasn't the same story like in the past. The leather padding is great. A pillow - like feel on the ears makes these comfortable to wear for hours. Adjusting them is very easy also. Just pull , right above the headphone, up or down to fit your ear height. Also the headphones fold inward for easy storage.

Battery usage is definitely a plus on these Beats! Their claims that it last about 40 hours is right on target. The first time I used them, the battery lasted about 38 hours but after I charged them it went as long as 42 hours on a single charge so go figure. The 10 minute fast charge does last a good 3 hours so that is definitely a plus in my book.

As for looks, you can't go wrong. Typical Beats good looks, just packaged in a smaller size. I went with the flat or matte black. I don't care for the ""fingerprint"" look so I didn't go with the glossy black because reviewers say it is a fingerprint magnet.

Connection is a breeze with Bluetooth and even better if you have the iPhone 7. If you don't have the iPhone 7 or iOS 10+ then Bluetooth connectivity is as usual: turn on the Bluetooth on your device and look for Solo3. For IPhone 7 or iOS 10+ just turn on the Bluetooth and connect it once and your iPhone will remember the Solo3. Now, the next time you turn on your Beats headphones it will automatically connect to your iPhone.

The Beats Solo3 package came with its own storage bag, USB A-to-USB micro-B for charging and a male to male 3.5mm cord to use the headphones without the use of the Bluetooth.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Not sure what the previous buyers received but I just got these Solo3 headphones December 2019 and they are phenominal! I was nervous ordering them after reading the previous reviews, but I’m SO glad I ignored them in this case. The packaging is legitimate and everything that is supposed to come with them comes with them. The sound is A++ and the noise cancellation is perfect! Buy them! They are worth it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These aren’t advertised to be noise-canceling, so I’m not sure why I’m asked to rate that aspect. My only complaint is that the ear cups hurt my ears over time; I’m not sure why they’re smaller than the Beats and Beats 2 I also own. I love the sound and the wireless feature - holds a charge forever!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I use my beats every day to listen to music, podcasts, and audiobooks.

You do have to break them in though, they hurt really bad for the first few days after only an hour or two of wearing and I have a small head.

They also get stretched out and then become too loose, so I can't use them to work out or really do anything but sit or walk while wearing. I don't even trust wearing them while washing dishes because they'll slip forwards off my face.

I love my beats but I wish they were designed to fit better.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I got these things as a gift from my wife last Christmas. By June the black cover around the ear piece began to fall off. Called in and covered under warranty and replaced no problem. Fast forward 6 months doing same exact thing but warranty no longer applies after they are replaced once. Definitely won’t buy this brand ever again. Shortly after the foam wore off they completely quit working on the right side. Technically $200 for 6 months of use,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Solo3 will not disappoint! If you're looking for headphones with crippling bass these ain't it. However, the balance of sound from high, low and mid is amazing! The bass doesn't drown out the others, nor do the others cancel the bass effect. Just a well rounded pair of headphones. Love them!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I didn't read the reviews before purchasing these, but after hitting the purchase button I decided to go through some and see if there was a common issue. Well, I kept seeing that people were reporting getting fakes/refurbished products. So I became alarmed. They were same day delivery so when I got home and saw the box I was nervous I was sent fakes or refurbished headphones. Well after doing thorough research and watching several youtube videos, I discovered they were in fact real. I have had them for a week now and my only complaint is that they are a bit tight over my ears where my glasses are, but I suppose that's my bad for wearing glasses. Otherwise, they hold a charge forever, my last beats (purchased new at Best Buy) only lasted maybe 6-8 hours. These can go a few days which is nice. The sound quality is good, though they are not noise cancelling. I didn't need that since I mainly use these in my office at work, and I want to be able to hear if someone knocks at my door or walks in. Overall, pretty good!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought this for my son. Who said the sound is excellent. The ear muffs ""just"" covers the ears. but this is fine watching my son who plays D1 HS Basketball he'll take this off and leave around his neck. Because the ear muffs are small it doesn't get in the way under his chin. We tested the range some bit. No problem about 30ft. away. Sound and stream was still excellent. of course you'll always have the disance limitations set forth with Bluetooth tech specifications.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They were beautiful and great sound but hurt my ears. I ended up returning these and getting a really nice pair of off brand, over the ear headphones and they are much more comfortable than these and have just as equally good sound quality and noise cancellation. It was very disappointing these didn’t work out.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros: These headphones have great quality sound.
Cons: they smash my ears so after wearing them for any period of time my ears are sore. Overall they are not comfortable to wear. Additionally the case that they come in is ever so slightly bigger than the headphones so they have to be put in the case perfectly to fit.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are great quality headphones. I have owned a bunch of Beats headphones in the past but this is my first wireless pair. The bluetooth function works great and they can be converted to wired headphones just by plugging in the included wire. Sound clarity is amazing along with the bass. The only issue I have with these, as with all solo's, is that after having them on your head for an extended time they will hurt your ears/ make them sore. I would opt for he studios if you can.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Really happy with the product. The only downside is that they sent the wrong color ( it was supposed to be gold and they are rose gold) unfortunately I leave to see my family next week and could not return. They are a gift for a boy so it’s kind of sad. Other than that, they work great!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"For $200 I expected these to last longer than 3 weeks! Within a 3 week time span the sound went completely out in one ear and was off and on in the other ear, by week 5 there was no sound coming out of the headset at all! They were a birthday gift to my son and I have not been able to get them replaced or repaired, so I just wasted $200. I will never trust Beats ever again!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these headphones for my sons birthday last November. He loved them. Couldn’t be happier. About 2 weeks ago he started having trouble with the right headphone. Sometimes he could hear out of it and sometimes he couldn’t. It finally gave out. He was so sad and I was frustrated because the 12-month warranty is about to expire. I contacted the company I purchased it from on amazon and they were wonderful. Answered my email right away and they should be sending replacement headphones. I’m
Hoping they come before my sons birthday. He will be so excited and happy. Follow up review to follow once they send them and we receive them. :)",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I ordered these beats because I could no longer wear my airpods with my new tragus piercing. The sound quality is great and the battery seems to last a really long time. My biggest complaint is that these are super uncomfortable for my ears. they hold on tightly and it’s like my ears are sore when I take them off. If it weren’t for that, I’d give them 5 stars. The color is nice and they seem durable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love my beats. Sounds great, easy to connect to my S8 phone or iPod. Battery last long. Charges fast. I use it during my train ride to work or workouts. My only regret is getting them in silver where the earpiece is white. They get dirty and you have to be careful cleaning them without damaging it. Otherwise, it's a great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not going to delve into the subjective territory of sound quality. I will say that the sound is rich and performs better than expected (especially given Beats' history of emphasizing bass). The battery life is stellar and Bluetooth connection has been impeccable with amazing range and only rare hiccups. My one complaint is that it is a snug fit on my ears: after 1-2 hours, they actually start to hurt my ears a little.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for my son who wrestles. He rocked these before 87 individual matches to get pumped up. No complaints. No issues with sweat. Great batter life. He's completely 100% content. 3 star on noice cancelling, but they aren't advertised as such. Eveything else is great.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Just got my Beats in the mail and I am absolutely in love with them!!! Sound is awesome, feel great on, love the matte black, brand new wrapped in plastic and everything inside was wrapped nicely as well. These are not reused or fake, they are the real deal! SO happy with my purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited so long to buy the headphones. I tested them at an Apple Store and was amazed by the sound fidelity and bass. Even my wife was impressed. But I wasn’t in a good financial status, so I skipped the purchase at the time. That was last year. I heard about Amazon Prime days and decided to wait. The Solo 3 was the 1st thing that popped out when searching for electronic devices. And for $139 this time I would not let it pass away. Simply the best headphones that I have bought. And let me tell you I have bought many.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Good quality sound, looks nice, but cheap quality. However the first one I got malfunctioned with virtually no physical damage. I got a replacement. However the replacement broke a few months later again with no physical damage. I am disappointed. The headphones don't work wirelessly under 0 degrees centigrade (32 F) so if you live in an area that gets cold in the winter expect to bring the wire.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Let’s start with, I love Mickey. I definitely waited for the price to drop because (sorry, not sorry) Beats just isn’t worth it. The Mickey print is a beautiful matte. I really adore them but of course the sound quality/clarity just isn’t there.
If you want great headphones for a decent price, please go with Vmoda! My cross fade 100 beat $300 Beats headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I got these on Prime Day for a discounted price. I am not a headphone connoisseur but I was looking for something that was a little more suited for the office than my wireless in ear headphones I use at the gym. I have a loud intern that sits next to me who is the life of the office and needed something to block the noise out. It works. A little too well sometimes. I jump out of my skin at least 4 times per day when someone touches my shoulder or I see them out of the corner of my eye. Works for me.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've been a content user of corded, over-the-ear-headphones forever, always barely tolerating the cord getting hung up on my office chair several times a day... I've also been a bit of a snob about the Beats brand, shunning the brand hype and the expense. Not sure what put me over the edge, but I couldn't be happier that I made the leap/cut the cord. These headphones are fantastic. Battery life is excellent - I've had them for about 2 months and the battery still is half-charged. Great bluetooth range, superb sound. I use them daily at my desk job and at home (yard work, wood working projects, etc.). The controls on the headset are slick as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love these things because they cancel out loud, obnoxious noises (like your animals whining while you're trying to focus and study for a big test). They are also very comfortable to wear. I've had on-ear headphones in the past that were so tight they gave me a headache. I could wear these all day studying if I needed to!",5.0 out of 5 stars
I was surprised by the solo 3s good sounding. Use them as workout headphones. Not worth 300 but got them on sale and they are good sounding plenty of volume not to bass heavy but got good sound and bass to them. And still using them to work out with no problems. Of course they always go back into the case.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent fit powerful sound I actually gave these to my daughter she wanted some wireless headphones for when she works out at the gym these have met her expectations and more they are very comfortable she said I have tried them on and they are very comfortable with that and the sound is great if you’re looking for the beat sound with the wireless capability then I would recommend these,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I really like these headphones overall, the sound quality is good and they're decently noise-isolating. HOWEVER, I've had them only for about a year, and the battery life and their condition has declined significantly. While previously I only had to charge them once a month (with use for HOURS daily) now they barely last a few days. In addition, one of the side hinges is broken, and that side of the headphones doesn't stay collapsed, and will kind of swing out at random. In general, I like these, but please be warned that they probably won't last much more than a year and a half with normal use. Personally, I think they're far too expensive to have declined this quickly.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these in November of 2018. It’s June of 2020 and they are already broken. One ear isn’t working at all and the other if I press on it it will work otherwise it goes in and out and sounds like static. For the price, they should last a lot longer than what they did. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these head phones precisely for the noise cancellation feature. My spouse has to have the volume so high while watching tv I was in Hope's of being able to cancel out the sound and listen to another device while being able to say in same room as the tv. Did not cancel noise.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Wanted to buy the Wifey a BOSE noise cancelling headphone instead, but she wanted these. Regret not doing it, but I’m a die hard BOSE fan. These are a nice set of headphones though. They produce great sound, not noise cancelling so if your looking for total submersion into the music, get some Noise cancelling headphones. All in all she’s happy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Five months and one side of the headphones goes out. The product started malfunctioning yesterday. Now, whenever I try to connect to a device wirelessly, one side is cut out. Not to mention the constant audio break up. The cord also stopped working after a month. Very disappointing. What a waste of $230!",1.0 out of 5 stars
I wear these headphones everyday to the gym and have been wearing them for a long time now. the sound quality is still amazing. the battery lasts extremely long and it charges very quick when low. one of the earphone covers just started to come undone but with the amount I have been wearing and sweating in them they still work amazing.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I absolutely love these headphones for my workouts. I previously had ear plugs and they were constantly coming out of my ear whenever I sweat so I would have to frequently stop my workouts to put back and readjust them in my ear which got super annoying when i'm trying to concentrate on burning some fat. I've been using these for about a week now and they are really great, i can focus on my workouts and the sound quality is totally bomb. i won't go into all the specs and technical mumbo jumbo cuz i don't know them, but if you're looking for something that stays put and has good sound quality and long battery life you can't go wrong with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I live in NYC, where the temperature at the the winter could be very low. For a couple of days temperature dropped down under 32 deegres Fahrenheit and I have difficulties to use my headphones outside my apartment. After 5 minutes outside, headphones switching off by themself. I can not turn them back on until, I am back to a warmer place for at least 5-10 minutes. I sent a message to Beats by Dre tech support, and I received an answer saying the optimum temperature for using this headphones is above 32 deegres Fahrenheit. So it means that I not gonna be able to use this product through the winter. On my opinion Beats shoul inform customers that they could expect difficulties using this equipment in the cold environment.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I have tried a few different head phones but wanted blue tooth and smaller ear cup size so it didn't look weird while I listed at work. For the price I really dont notice a great sound difference from something like my BOHM headphones at a third of the price. I have glasses and these things kill my ear as they are so tight with no way to loosen them. I would have expect more out of something so pricey.,3.0 out of 5 stars
They were working well the first 2 weeks and then everything went down hill. The sound would start failing in the right ear until it was completely gone and I could only hear from one ear. Then it wouldn’t connect to the Bluetooth on my phone. And after a while I had to call amazon for help on what to do because I had it for a little over a month.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Best wireless headphones hands-down! These are the easiest plug and play headphones ever. Right out of the box, they come with easy to start instructions, how to use the buttons and connect blue tooth. I was up and running in less than 2 minutes. They also fold really well into a case that is included. I'm really happy with the sounds, and they are very much noise-cancelling in my opinion even though I'm not sure it's advertised to be. Very comfortable, long battery life and well worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They look great. If looks are your thing, grab these. If you don’t really care about looks and sound quality is your thing then you can definitely find something better for this price. That’s the biggest issue with Beats.. Price. But even then, the sound isn’t bad, just not good enough for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Poorly made headphones. While the sound quality and noise cancelation are great, within six months of use the padding cover started coming off. For the amount of money spent on these, that shouldn’t have been an issue. I had knockoffs that lasted years.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First problem may not be 100% Beat's fault, however, they are an Apple product. They don't play nice with Bluetooth. Failure and intermittent connection, dropped connection, both on Apple computers. Maybe not Beat's fault, but they are useless for the intended purpose if unable to establish a reliable Bluetooth connection.
Second problem, they are uncomfortably tight on the ears.
Third, the on/off switch offers no tactile functionality. The headphones must be removed and looked at in order to power on (or off).
The sound quality and noise cancelling are fine, but so is every other brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"They worked amazing for the first couple months and then I had trouble with Bluetooth connection, the aux cord thing it comes with had a short in it so it sounds static-y with it in PLUS to top it off the right side stopped working on the headphones. I contacted amazon but they said I had to contact the beats support and the repair would cost almost as much as it would to replace the entire headphones. HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Love Beats overall, have used the wired ones for a few years. And now have the wireless. I highly recommend. These are perfect for people with smaller features. I’ve tried other over the ear headphones and they are huge and look silly. These are compact and cool. The charge lasts a long time. Read the instructions to figure out the headset controls like volume.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Fantastic headphones that quickly became a staple in my workout routine. I enjoy the moderate noise cancellation they provide. It’s not perfect, but I never needed it to be. It blocks just enough noise to allow for a nap on a plane or to focus on your workout in the gym. I really love these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I expected much better sound quality for the price. I have bought much less expensive ones that sound better. I only use these to workout. And when I lay down on the bench or on the floor, they are always falling off. Even when I have them completely tightened.",3.0 out of 5 stars
I love the Beats brand. They never fail when it comes to great sound. The quality of these headphones are great. They are very durable. The color is my favorite so that is great too. The battery lasts forever. I usually use these while i'm working out and doing chores around my house and I may have to charge them twice a month. This is my second pair of beats and they are only getting better.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my second set of Beats, the first Blue tooth. These are super comfortable, and easy to install on both my iPhone and iPad. However, since I live in colder climate, if the temps are in the upper to mid 30s, the headphones only last 15 mins at the most. Even if I wear a hoodie, they don't last much longer. This happens when the battery is fully charged, so there must be a shutoff when the headphones hit a certain temp. The battery doesn't drain, it just turns off. I would not buy these again.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"After 6 months, the ear cover has separated and cannot be easily fixed. Apple support was not much help and repair would be at cost plus $100 RT uber ride to a service provider 20 miles away.

The right ear shorted out after 3 months. The left ear scratches out now 4 months after I bought them. I'm really unhappy. I don't use them near water or anything strange that would lead to the short out.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"My first time spending $200 on headphones and was impressed with battery life and quality of music for a year. I connect them via Bluetooth as I have on very flight and the right earphone has no sound. I spend every minute u til takeoff trying to google remedies and disconnect/reconnect and reset. I didn’t get them wet, used the case religiously. If I had known they wouldn’t last 13 months I would not have spent that much. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was super excited to get these headphones. After about 20 minutes of wearing them, i took them off and my ears were throbbing! They are very painful to wear. I can't get past the pain so I'll be returning these, which is unfortunate because the sound is amazing and they fit me way better then the Bose soundlink headphones.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Stylish and sound great, but stopped working properly after less than a year. One of the ears goes in and out depending on your head position. A wire is probably a little loose on the inside. As pricey as these are I'd expect them to be more durable after being stored in the case and only being used lightly for a year.

Luckily they still had 6 days left on their one year warranty and Apple repaired them for free.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"My daughter absolutely loves her new Beats, she hasn’t heard a thing anyone has said to her since Christmas morning.
All kidding aside the headphones themselves are very nice. They have amazing sound quality, and they look and feel great. It took my daughter all of 3min to connect to her phone, set them up, and start listening to music.
Will buy another pair for myself, so that I can pretend not to hear my wife.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my first over the ear headphones. They pair easily with my iPhone and my Microsoft Surface Laptop for calls and music on both devices. The sound quality is good and people say they hear me clearly. I haven’t tried outdoor calls yet where it may pick up other environmental sounds.

The only negative is they get a bit uncomfortable on my ears when I wear them for longer periods. I think the ear cushions could be softer.

Next time I’ll consider spending more for more comfortable headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love these. The battery life on these last a reeeallly long time. Ear cups aren’t very large so they don’t comfortably cover the whole ear.

"Great sound and are compact so they are able to fit into smaller bags when they are folded. The battery lasts pretty long, I was quite surprised. I hardly ever have to charge them and I use them almost daily for the gym. The only complaint I have is they're not comfortable when wearing with glasses. They're a big snug on the ear so they do start to hurt a little when wearing your glasses.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Your used headphones purchased at full price may come with cat fur, earwax and dandruff like mine. That’s nasty.

This is a good stuff. I've used it for a long time. Not any issues. But I don't know how to discuss it. I just want to clean up the review. Because when I look at the review which hasn't reviewed that I will feel uncomfortable. That's it.,5.0 out of 5 stars
I got the glossy black. Love this product. It's legit. Battery lasts a long time. Glossy black does not scratch easily. I even hit it HARD against a piece of equipment at the gym and the dent is still so tiny and not noticeable - so it is DURABLE.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"My husband loved these. They were great with his low hearing. However, they do not stand up to use while working. They have never been wet, always kept in the case. And just after the end of warranty they quit working. We think it’s because they couldn’t stand up to use while sweating. Can’t come up with any other reason for them to just quit like that after being so well taken care of. It was almost like they shorted. He was wearing them and everything was fine mowing then lawn and the boom, they were dead.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a gift. When I opened them, I was disappointed to see that the black material did not completely cover the ear phones on either side. The beige foam sticks out all around the ear phones on both sides. When I try to stretch the black material across the earphone to cover the foam—it won’t go--it’s WAY too small and will not stay in place.
If they don’t bother to refurbish them enough to make them look good on the outside, it’s doubtful that quality work was done inside. NO ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

"Best bluetooth headphone. Period. Quality is good but most important is you dont need to pair unpair anymore in order to connect to your phone, mac, ipad, watch. It connects to all at once and while listening music from mac if you get a call on iphone then you can just switch to iphone and vice versa. This is a great feature. When I go for jog then I just connect to my watch without unpairing. I have two and my daughter loves it as she can use between her laptop, phone and ipad.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have taken very good care of them . I charged them last night so I could use them today and they would not pair. the pair light wont even come on. so I plugged them in to use and sound only comes out on the right and nothing on the right ! In my opinion . 300.00 is way to much to spend on something you only got to use 4 times. Ive had cheap ear phones that last way longer and when they bite the dust you can afford to replace them .

Bought these for my teenage daughter for Christmas she loves them. I did put them on and wow are they comfortable and the sound quality is great! She was amazed how far from her phone she could get and still not be disconnected. I know this is something she will use for a long time. They are a great color in the silver and the quality is great!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these for a Christmas present (i’m an early shopper). When my son opened them on Christmas, they would not work and the window for returns had already closed. There’s not even a way to contact the seller to explain my situation? Beyond annoying! Now it’s on my list of To do’s to try and figure out if they can be fixed. These were way too expensive for such disappointment- in the product AND the lack of customer service",1.0 out of 5 stars

Please look at the pics before you make a purchase decision.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Material around the are ear headphones are separated after reading many reviews there seems to be ongoing problem I called Apple but they want to hold a credit card on file and have them mailed in. Considering the PRICE of these headphones they should be backing up their product...other than that they have a very good sound and battery life on them are very good.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I had bought 1 powerbeats and it quit on me after a firmware update, got it replaced with another one and it quit for no reason, all this within 1 1/2 years. Bought a solo 3 just a couple of months ago and now it will not stay connected via BT. Called support and walked me thru the reset steps, which i had already done, now they say send it in. i'M SICK OF PAYING BIG BUCKS (224.00) NOT HAVING IT FOR MORE THAN 2 YEARS AND HAVE TO GET IT REPLACED.

"Great headphones for all purposes unless you plan on wearing them when the temperature drops near 32°F or below. These headphones have a wonderfully long battery life, effortless connections to I-devices, good sound and great usability. My problem, and it’s a big one, is that is impossible to use these headphones as a wireless device when the temperature drops close to or below freezing. At that point, the headphones turn off automatically anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes later depending on how cold it is. Sometimes, when the temperatures only at 32°, I can get up to 20 to 25 minutes before they turn off. I have called Apple and I have been told that this is typical for battery powered wireless headphones. I have not substantiated this statement with other brands.",3.0 out of 5 stars
For the price doesnt sound that good its just ok it lacks mid its mostly bass its not worth $199 or $129 on sale .jbl live 400 sounds better for $ 69 ..but quality its really good.im not sure im keeping it ill try for a week will see,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Super great headphones ever have. Was having a wired Philips and a SONY headphone, but always felt painful on both ears because wrapping too tightly to ears. This Beats Solo3 doesn't make such problem to me.

In terms of BT/wireless, it works wonderfully as I have many apple products and the Solo3 connects to all of them with easy set up and very good music quality. The long durability of battery juice and long distance of reception make me thumbs up!! I work in a lab often leave my phone on desk and walk around benches and even cross the hall way to another room. I never get problem to receive BT signals from my iphone7. It's also easy to check battery status using iphone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I had another pair of these that I ordered from Apple that were stolen and I was devastated because I love them so much that I ordered another pair. They are sound cancelling and comfortable sitting over the ear. I was never into bulky headphones like this before but after owning these I probably won't get anything else. I even use them when I shoot my gun because the noise cancelling is that good. I recommend them if you are considering buying them!,5.0 out of 5 stars
Great headset. Flawless pairing with all your apple devices. Legitimate 40 hours battery life and the range across our 3 level home no drops at all. The fatal flaw is i like to walk the dog in winter; if its cold; the unit shuts off purposely at around 32 degrees and no more music for the rest of the walk; i had 2 when i realized this i returned 1. They get more comfortable with continued use; not as comfy as the bose on ear bluetooth. Overall good purchase.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Wow. If you are a bass lover and primarily listen to rap or R&B, you are certainly in for a treat. These look great and although the clarity is not quite as good as other brands such as Bose or Sennheiser, they excel in the bass department. They are sleek and beautiful making these the best looking headphones money can buy and won’t stick out if you so chose to wear them with your favorite outfit. Overall, I strongly recommend these to just about anybody looking for a great overall headphone with great sound quality, bass, battery, aesthetics, and style all in one.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"these are awful . at first I was really happy to get them and they looked really authentic and sounded great ! I’ve had them for almost a year now and as I was dancing and listening to my music, the right speaker stopped working . not to mention the circle part that allows you to change the volume randomly fell off on its own while I was listening to music maybe 6 months back . for 6 months I have been having it taped to my headphones just for them to end up trash all together . just save the money because these ain’t it .",1.0 out of 5 stars
If you like loud music beware. The wireless on these does not allow for loud music. I tested my regular Beats Solo with the same music and phone and the wireless just wont get as loud. I sent them back. Would rather deal with wires instead of not being able to enjoy loud music.,2.0 out of 5 stars
What more can be said. The main thing you probably want to know is it new and does it look as advertised. Answer is yes to both. I just bought a second set for my son for him to use at the gym. He loves them.,5.0 out of 5 stars

I bought these for my 9 year old for his birthday and we both love them. (I use them at the gym occasionally and have even run in them). The battery lasts forever and they look sharp but not too bulky. They are comfortable and the sound is very good. I like that they fold up nicely to fit in a small case that is easy to toss into a backpack or purse. I have been very happy with this purchase and I love the gold color. Not too flashy but still cool looking.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have had these for about a year and a half and the left earphone stopped working. If you do research, this is a VERY VERY common problem and it is not an easy fix or you'll have to send it in for repair which costs a significant amount of money. Extremely disappointed that I paid this much for head phones that barely last - and mine are in pristine condition physically. I gave Beats a chance after ignoring all the 'haters' online, and now I wish I would have listened. NEVER AGAIN. Do yourself a favor and look at Bose, Sony, etc. it is not worth it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Mine are real Beats headphones, so I don't know what the other people are talking about. Great quality sound! Also I love that these are made with a female's head shape in mind, it fits well on a smaller female's head and ears.Very comfortable too! I love the rose gold because it matches my iPhone!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Absolutely best sound I’ve heard from headphones ever! You can’t get any better quality then what I got from Beats. My only issue is that I have large ears so I’m exchanging this pair for a different color for my daughter and I’m getting the larger size.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"No active noise cancellation, the ear cups blocks some sound. I like the 40 hours play on single charge but ears get way too hot and sweaty! Little too tight for long uses, hopefully it will stretch out in time. Used it with the headphone jack and Bluetooth, the Bluetooth never dropped off. Let’s see if the sound quality gets better with use.",3.0 out of 5 stars
I actually like these and I am the furthest thing in the world from a Beats guy. The sound is fun they actually feel good on my head. Are the worth the $300 list price? Probably not but I got mine for $200 and you could probably do better than that. I just hope they hold up. Recommended.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"they fit a little tight on my head which makes it uncomfortable, but otherwise they are great. they charge so fast which is great! when you don’t have the headphones on you can hear what they are playing i would say pretty loudly, but i knew they were supposed to do that but people can easily hear what your listening to even if the it is at a very low volume.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Product has excellent sound quality and quick charging. The audio cord was broken when I received it. Thought no big deal since it was brand new and still under warranty. I was totally mistaken. When I called Apple to get a new cord, I was told that it was already out of warranty by two years. What??? The warranty started when the product was purchased two years ago by the seller (AMAZON) from Apple. Now that I know this, I will be very careful about what I purchase from Amazon. I ended up paying for a new audio cord.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these headphones for my son who is autistic and hopes that it would help cancel out some of the noise around us while he was watching videos or listening to music. So far they have worked wonders and have really helped him be able to be in big groups of people and change from different settings from loud to quiet.,5.0 out of 5 stars

They have felt great so far and I've now had them for a few months and don't notice much wear and tear. They sound amazing still and the battery lasts for more than enough time for whatever activity.

I love them they are great. They have a great sound quality and are very comfortable. I was using them in a restaurant and I couldn't hear the music playing in the background. Even though they don't have electric noise canceling any background noise is hard to hear. I like how they came with a cord to use when the headphone dies. Great quality.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I was happy with the headphones, but after 6 months the right side stopped working when being used in bluetooth mode. It works completely fine if using the cable. I did some research online and apparently others have experienced a similar situation. Someone mentioned to try using the cable, but barely touch it to the port and that does bring both back to working, but as soon as you move it will stop working again. For the price of this product i expected better quality that would last.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"This are my new favorite headphones. I have absolutely no complaints. The fact that they come with a detachable cord in case you forget to charge them is very nice (even if most phones can't use the cord anymore).

Also, if you have any kind of problem with them, you get access to Apple's world class customer support. Just to be clear, there was no sarcasm in that last statement, they go above and beyond. I only wish I had purchased an iPhone...",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have had many problems with the pair of beats I ordered. First of all, the hinges started making some weird noise after moderate use of 2 weeks. When the ear cups loosened up, it started leaking so much noise. It is really irritating in college so I will get the studio 3 and give the solo 3 to my gf.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Overrated in my opinion. I've owned these for a 1 year and 3 months and they are now dead. I used these 3 times a week at the gym. For $300.00 I feel like headphones should last a couple years. The once a month charging was nice but I will not be buying any more Beats.,1.0 out of 5 stars
AWESOME! If you’re on the fence about buying these then JUST DO IT! It’s crazy how well they cancel out background noise. Me and my kids “experimented” with it when they first arrived. Unbelievable!

Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves them. They must work really well because she never hears me or my wife calling her when she has them on lol.

"The beats came in what appeared to be good condition, but they do not work to talk on the phone. I don’t know if it’s an issue with the beats themselves, or the actual wire that came with the beats to use for phone calls, but when I plug the cord in, the audio only comes out of one ear and it’s bad quality. Other than this, they look good cosmetically but I was really looking forward to using them for calls as well as normal audio. They are also used. Not worth the money",1.0 out of 5 stars

"I love my beats! They aren’t completely noise cancelling, but they have great sound. Super cute and comes with a storage pouch.

"Great headphones for the price!! I would definitely recommend for anyone that wants good quality Bluetooth headset for a minimal price, but two caveats, one if they are one your ears for too long, they can feel uncomfortable for a minute or so when you take them off, also the volume control on the headset is great but messes up at times making me accidentally pause or skip songs entirely. However, it is overall great and worth the money if you have it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound is not audiophile quality, heavy on bass, and overall good sound quality. But what really makes them great is the technology - the W1 chip, in combination with the iPhone 7 is a great combination. Battery life is insane (in the almost 2 months I have them, I have charged them only twice. Range is also insane while connectivity is a breeze. This is the perfect wireless combination for iPhone 7, hands down.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Not worth the price, sound is not of quality with other headphones of similar pricing, Bluetooth connectivity is spotty in a multiresidential environment and made with cheap materials. Mine broke at the plastic fold mechanism, leather always pulling apart from earpiece and I babied this headset. Band is really tight, ears hurt after less than an hour of use. This came with holographic security, so assume they're real. They are just not worth the price, turns me off to any of their other products, present or future.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"My daughter got these Beats for Christmas 2017, in June 2018 one side of the headphones quit working! Apparently that is common. Apple replaced them free of charge and all was good. Then in January 2019 one side of the extension area broke. Once again I contacted Apple support, however this time instead of a 1 year warranty, the replacements only had a 90 day warranty! So I could pay $129 plus S/H to get them repaired or I could spend another $200 and just buy new ones! Neither option appealed to me!!! VERY FRUSTRATED!!!!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars

Finally today, when I was taking it off of my head the right arm broke for no reason and I had to glue it unless it doesn't stay on my head.

"Sound quality (range of frequency response) wasn't what I had hoped - bass not heavy and treble not as clear as other headphones in the same price range. Tried numerous sound settings on both my iPhone and my Mac. Still, it's solidly built but would recommend getting the extended warranty. My hunch is if used by an 'active' person (hiker, runner, etc.) the combination of natural shock absorption and sweat will increase the 'age' of the product.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought Beats, bought Asurion policy, Beats broke twice. First time Asurion fixed, 2nd time Asurion is jacking us around. They send label, we send back, Asurion sends them back to us still broken; no repair or attempt at repair made.
We bought them to use, not to spend all of our time mailing them back and forth to Asurion,
Poor quality.

I was really excited to try these headphones and when I got them I was unfortunately let down. They squeezed my head so hard I got a headache 2 days in a row. The ear pads are also really uncomfortable in my opinion. Sound quality was pretty good but poor noise cancellation. Overall I can see why people like these but if you have a small head and ears like me good luck.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I got about a years worth of use from these headphones before they started to give me some problems. First, the bluetooth function stopped working and shortly after the audio in the right ear cup stopped working as well. So now they only work with the wire and audio only comes out from the left ear cup. Id definitely recommend spending your money on a different pair of headphones.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"After several weeks of researching, comparing and reading reviews, we bought the Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones. I originally wanted the Bose QuietComfort 35’s or the Beats Studios. I tried them on, tested them out in-store and was having a hard time deciding. I saw a pair of th Solo3’s and tried them on, (not sure how I’d feel about the on-ear versus the over-the-eat style.) I was amazed that the Solo3 sounded just as great as the Bose (in my opinion). While not offering noise canceling, I could still hear most things around me with the Bose and Beats Studios. I felt the sound quality was just as good and I could hear just as much noise with the Solo3’s as the other two with noise-canceling. So we bought two, had them for 2 weeks now and traveled with them... we are extremely happy with them and would buy them again!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"The BEST headphones I have ever owned. Im a bit of a sucker for looks and brand which people criticize a lot of Beats users for but I say screw those people because you can have both looks AND quality with Beats. I had the beats solo 2 wireless and I cant begin to tell you what a step up the Solo 3's are. The battery life is seriously unbelievable. I use them ranging from 3-4 hours a day and sometimes up to 6 hours (I use them for work) and the battery lasts WEEKS its seriously incredible. When the battery gets low ill charge for 5 minutes and it's back up to 3 dots. It's INCREDIBLE, I dont even think my old Nokia's battery lasted this long! The finish of these headphones is about the same as the Solo 2's except for the gorgeous shiny rose gold accents as opposed to the fully matte finish of the Solo 2's. These headphones look amazing, sound even better, and the battery lasts a ridiculously long time. The price tag is hefty but as someone who uses these every day for work they were worth every penny.

I've noticed some people complaining about the same issue the Solo 2's had. It's uncomfortable to use them for an extended period of time because they are tight. Yes, at first they ARE pretty tight on your skull and are unbearable for over 2 hours. However, over time they DO stretch out and guys this happens to most On-Ear headphones. If you have very large ears I would recommend getting the Studios since they are OVER ear. If you want to speed out the stretch out process just stretch them out over something about the same size as your head and leave them overnight. Repeat this until they are comfy although dont stretch them too much or they will fall easily. I use these now for up to 6 hours at a time and they are very comfy. If you have earrings you might want to take them off before prolonged use, the back of the earrings will be poking into your skull.

Overall these headphones impressed me and this is coming from someone who already owned the great Solo 2's. You will not regret getting these.

"The sound quality was very good, but the headphones leak a lot of sound so if you're listening in a quiet place, everyone can hear your music. Also, these headphones are not headphones for being active, because they fall off a lot. The material and the quality of them though, is very good. Also very comfortable. Again though, if you plan on doing anything active, these are not the right ones. Update, the rubber cushion on the head strap came off of the headphones",5.0 out of 5 stars

"First I was spectical that these were even on sale because we all know Beats are overpriced for what you get. Thank being said, since these are discounted they are definitely a great buy. I wouldn't spend $300 on these but I will $220. These are real and they came in the original packaging.

Now for the review. As others have noticed that Beats are very bass heavy, I like this even though I listen to a lot of metal but to some they don't like it. The sound populated is excellent. There aren't any cracks or interruptions at all. These are a very high quality SOUND headphone. My issue isn't with the sound or the Bluetooth connectivity.

These headphones, as other solos are, are built cheap. The sound coming out is great but the design is made out of plastic and i wouldn't recommend anyone going to the gym with these. Get the power beats if you're going to the gym. These feel like they will break and I have a feeling they will If I drop them hard enough. The ear cups re great leather quality and feel comfortable. I wish they went away with the plastic and made all the models like the beats pro were. The material in the design definitely needs work.

The Bluetooth connectivity is marvelous with this W1 chip. The range is insane. I went outside my house and down the street and was still connected without interuption. i don't understand everyone saying connecting is any different. Yes there's a pop up that says connect but all my other bluetooth headphones automatically connect after the initial set up anyway so I don't get this ""amaazing set up"" everyone is talking about.

One more thing I would like to point out are phone calls. The phone calls are so crystal clear. No one can tell I'm using headphones which is hard with Bluetooth nowadays. All around these are a great buy and I would buy them again (not for $300 of course). Sound quality is great, cal quality is great, if you can get over the plastic buy these!",5.0 out of 5 stars

El único problema es que molestan un poco luego de un rato, se conectan al Laptop o el teléfono, intercambiándose sin problemas. Muy Buena compra.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Much cheaper units out there but bought these for the 40h battery life for 2 kids in cars/planes. So far ok. If you don’t care if you have to charge after every 10h of use I’d definitely buy cheaper/better quality made then this.,4.0 out of 5 stars

love the headphones bought them for all my long summer flights on the planes....but the cord to plug into the TV on the plane stopped working after one use.

"Don't buy these. These are the second pair I've gotten and they both stopped working in the same way. The first pair worked for about 2 weeks then it started having issue with charging and connecting wirelessly. Amazon replaced them and after a few more weeks, the same issue has come up. Now the 2nd pair doesn't charge properly or connect wirelessly. Too much money to spend on headphones that malfunction so easily.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"Great that I received someone else's used beats... I was a little skeptical when the box was not even wrapped. When I opened it, the headphones were scratched up and the cups had earwax in them. Absolutely unlike Amazon to send used beats when they are marked as new. When I paired to the device, it already pops up as Christian's beats solo 3. So Christian, absolutely brilliant but you need to clean your ears. As if that wasn't enough, the left ear just did not work at all. Very disappointed. Save yourself the trouble, buy these at best buy for the same price.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Received these today and they are difinently not beats. They are the cheapest knock off I can imagine. No power button, no volume buttons, no charging port and no markings of beats at all.

I have been using these headphones at the gym every day for a couple months now and the headphones have gotten loose to the point that I have to hold them in place if I am doing anything like looking down... a bit disappointed as I have taken extremely careful care of them and always put them back in case when not in use.,3.0 out of 5 stars

"These are the second pair of beats I have purchased, and they are great. I know they get a lot of complaints by music professionals as not being ""the"" top quality music output. However, to my amateur ears, I think that they are perfectly fine. The battery lasts forever....I usually have to charge them only every 2-3 weeks, and use them almost every day. Compared to pretty much any other rechargeable product, their battery life is amazing. I don't know how many long haul flights I have planned, and the morning of realized that I had forgotten to charge my ipad/computer...etc. These headphones are great, since they last so long. The music quality is more than sufficient for me, and the fact that they fold up means I can throw them in my purse pretty easily. I use them on my commute, for travel, and when I work out! Great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Item worked for a few months. Now they will not ppwer on and stay on. Upon trying to regoster for support unable to do so. I do not see help offered from Amazon site for assistance.

And I'm not talking about arctic temps, I'm merely outside in mid-20's degrees, and the battery shuts down. I looked at the beats website and other sites, and this is a well-known design flaw.

So, I can work out, listen to amazing quality sound, and never re-adjust. I could get all technical and specific but I think that says it all!! They're pricey but so worth it! Added bonus, they look pretty too <3",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I seriously wanted to love these.
Even using different EQ settings it just didn't have the quality of sound I've found from less expensive Bluetooth headphones. They have great battery life and range, but if you like to hear bass like, like a bass chello. Forget it. Even in deep bass EQ. it's a no go.

"Apple has a problem with the batteries in their headphones. I've bought 4 pairs of them either for myself or as gifts and 2 of them have had the same battery failure issue. Eventually they just stop charging. Then you have to drive into the Apple store, wait in line, have them send them out, and drive back. Fortunately they often get stolen before they fail. That's about the best feature. The sound is good when they work. Would never buy another pair.",1.0 out of 5 stars

These headphones worked fine yesterday and most of today. Then suddenly the sound is super muffled and I have no idea why. Not sure if I got a defective pair or if these are knockoffs. They have been kept in their case when not on my head because they seem delicate. If the sound doesn't randomly snap back they are going to be worthless.,1.0 out of 5 stars

The on the ear design isn’t comfortable and I can’t tell if that is just because they are on my ears instead of over them as my bose are or if the band is just too small for my head and is squeezing the ear pieces to my ears instead applying a little pressure to keep them in place,2.0 out of 5 stars

With the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, I can walk from one end of my home to the next and even check my mail. There have been times that I forgot they were connected to my S8+ and pull out of the drive-way and they're still connected. The battery life is great and charges quickly. VERY easy to use, no extra buttons to press on accident; just volume up/down, play and pause, and power -that is all you really need. My next pair will be of a different color.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Wanted a decent pair of wireless headphones after always catching a cord at work and breaking other pairs. I looked at a few pairs, these, some Bose headphones and some V-Moda. Honestly these probably had the lowest reviews of the 3. Not bad reviews, but lower than the other two in general so I was hesitant. I also had never read great things about older Beats, but they came down in price some to about 70 less than the other two so I decided to give it a shot.

I am pleasantly surprised. I am by no means an audiophile so that may help, but I think they sound very good. Pretty full sound, I don't think it's the best by any means, but it's a good sound and enjoyable to listen to. Range also seems really good on the bluetooth.

As far as comfort. They definitely could be tight to some. They kind of clamp down on the ears. I don't find this bad, but it's definitely something to consider in a purchase. I think overall they are very comfortable so far. A little hot under the ears after a bit maybe, but not bad.

I would recommend them if you want a decent pair of wireless headphones. Good sound, easy to pair, comfortable. Oh, and it also came with 30 bucks on the itunes store or 3 months of apple music. Since I will use that it's like I saved another 30 bucks on them which really makes them a great deal.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I love the sound of these headphones. My problem is I purchased them in July and as of today the ear pads are already coming apart! I will never buy this brand again. I decided to give them a 2nd chance after problems with my Solo2 headphones....I have learned my lesson!!!,3.0 out of 5 stars

"For the price and overall sound quality, a very good buy. You maybe could find these headphones for a few dollars cheaper w/ free shipping, however overall as a gift, these headphones arrived in excellent condition and work exceedingly well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
But why didn't the material last atleast a year tho?,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I am extremely pleased with this purchase. First of all, it arrived on time and in great condition. I was a bit skeptical about purchasing due to some of the comments that I read, however, I decided to bite the bullet and make the purchase. There were concerns if the headphones were genuine (as in, true Beats)- yes, they are. These Beats by Dre wireless headphones are the best, I do not know why I waited so long to make the purchase! The sound is crisp and clear and my music sounds like it is live.

Setup was not difficult and I like that it automatically pairs with my phone so I can listen to my music. I have a Samsung S7 and it works perfectly- no problems at all.

I purchased these headphones for the gym. I lift weights, spin, and run in them. I have not experienced the issue some people complain about regarding sweating (and I tend to sweat when I am running). My headphones still stay on my head. For those that have that issue, I would recommend tying a scarf on your head. It will help hold the headphones in place.

Overall, I am a satisfied customer.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are trash to put it simply. The sound quality is not as good as I thought it would be. I had the original beats the they first came out and those were so much better in terms of sound and product quality. I was really excited about these but ended up very disappointed. I'm returning them for my money back. Not at all impressed.,2.0 out of 5 stars
Beats are the best. The sound and quality is amazing and they last forever. I charged them once and they lasted for more than 2 weeks using at least 3hrs a day... very surprising,5.0 out of 5 stars
Purchased the headphones April 2017. By April 2018 the cover on the headphones started to come off. I contacted Apple to repair but they said it would cost $130 to repair because I was out of the one year warranty. now the entire ear muff has come off. I would suggest get an extended warranty if you are going to buy these are buy another product.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Worked fine with apple watch at the gym every day for 5 months. then one day they acted like they had no battery life; wouldn't turn on. followed Dr Dre Beat website instructions for resetting them, but I all I could get is the power led on (white) and a one red led.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"I got these a few days ago and they were perfect, I had a long debate on whether I should get the Bose headphones or these Beats. The Beats won out. However after only a few days of ownership they are already malfunctioning. On two separate occasions while working out at the gym the volume levels would change on their own. Which doesn’t seem too bad I guess But considering these headphones are over $200 I was hoping for a good quality product. I am currently waiting on replacements and fingers crossed this doesn’t happen again otherwise I guess I will just go for the Bose.

Update: decided to just get a refund and go with another brand entirely after reading more negative reviews",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless headphones and bought the Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones yesterday. I did a side by side comparison and I gotta say, the Solo 3's sound better.... way better. I know Beats are geared more toward a the low end of the sound spectrum, but I played Hip Hop, Classical, Country, Rock and some Acapela. Every test had the Solo 3's as the clear winner. Even down to the sound isolation, and the Studios have ""noise cancellation"".

There's only one negative, it is the carrying case. Could they not make it a tad bigger?! I feel like just one more centimeter of room would have shaved at least 3 minutes off putting them in the bag. ;)

I have to be transparent, I got these for $210 on another large retailer's site (think the rain forest). Would I pay 300 plus tax? Probably, but the point is, you can't find them for less, just make sure the place you're buying them from is legit.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Heads-up - this is a lengthy review - but when you are considering a headphone at this price you deserve as much review as you can get to help you decide! I will rate by topic so you can also focus on what is most important to you. Let's start with context. These are my first Beats headphones - wired or wireless. They are not of course my first wireless or wired headphones. I have several wireless headphones including Jabra Move and Jaybird BlueBuds X. I also have several wired headphones with my favorites being KEF M500 (on ear) and Oppo PM-2 (over ear). My sound preference in a headphone is crisp and clear highs and mids with a presence and ""definition"" of bass - but not over done. Yea, I'm not a bass-head. So here we go...

WIRELESS (5 / 5):
Right off the bat, this is where these headphone excel, and why I considered and bought them in the first place. They are by far the easiest bluetooth headphones I have used to pair and manage with multiple devices. This of course assumes you are very deep in the Apple eco-system - which I am. I use these headphones with an iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Initial pairing was simple and automatic with my iPhone - place it next to it, turned it on, hit accept and done. Then in seconds the headphone showed up in all my Apple devices! And switching between what device is connected and active is just as easy. I could never get previous wireless headphones I owned to play nice with multiple devices even though they supposedly supported this feature. One wireless headphone always went back and forth between my iPhone and iPad even when I was in the middle of listening to music on my iPhone. Not so with the Solo3! And the range and battery life are incredible. I have owned my Solo3 for over a week and I am still on the initial charge. So hands down wireless performance is the best feature of these headphones.

COMFORT (4 / 5):
The Solo3 is an on-ear headphone and for me they are actually quite comfortable. The leather pads are comfortable and seal well - though they are not as soft as the pads on my KEFs. But maybe they will soften over time. The ""clamping"" of the Solo3 is firm and keeps the headphones very stable during moderate activity but not so tight that they bother my ears at all. The headband liner is comfortable for me too - I don't seem to have the rubbing problem some people have mentioned. And the plastic construction (see again under quality) actually has one plus in that it keeps the headphones light. I almost don't notice they are on my head until... The good seal and firm/thick pads cause my ears to heat up after about 30 mins so I do have to take them off for short ""cool-down"" breaks.

QUALITY (3 / 5):
This is a hard one to judge short term so my rating here is certainly preliminary. Bottom line - admittedly there is a lot of plastic here. Yes, it is a plus under comfort as it keeps the headphones light. But when you get in to this price range you defiantly see more metals and leathers and less plastic. And some wired headphones I have are so solid they have lasted me over a decade! I am not sure I will be able to say that about these headphones. And a 1 year warranty is not very confident - some headphones starting at this price point offer up to 3 years. It would certainly inspire confidence if Beats backed these a bit more and made me feel like the plastic construction was solid and truly there for comfort (weight). That said its too early to bash longevity yet.

SOUND (4 / 5):
Ok now the final and most subjective topic - the sound quality. Recall my sound preference - not a bass-head. When I first heard about these headphones with the new wireless chip - I was interested because of all the hassles I had before with bluetooth headphones. But because they were Beats I struggled to decide to purchase or not. I have not owned Beats because Beats headphones I listened to in the past were definitely too much bass for me - thudding and muffled. But I decided to give it a try - I could always return them. They are not going back! The sound is actually a pleasant surprise. Yes, they are more bass then what I own now - but they sound more balanced then what I remember. You can hear good mids and highs - though they are certainly more reserved. And the spatial separation is very good - these give a full and well spaced sound that makes you feel like you are indeed in the middle of the studio or concert. They excel with more Rock then Classical, so there still is a place for my wired headphones, but I also don't feel like I have to sacrifice sound quality to get wireless convenience.

OVERALL (4 / 5):
Overall, these are very good wireless headphones - they are now my primary go to wireless headphones for sound quality and convenience across all my Apple devices - though I am keeping my set of wireless Jaybirds for intense workouts only. They are even what I turn to now over my wired headphones for most music/podcasts unless I want to immerse myself in some Acoustic, Classical or Jazz where I still prefer my wired options. Value is good - plastic to price ratio is not ideal - but it is offset by the wireless simplicity and sound. If you want a no-compromise wireless experience, you should at least consider these headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars
At this point I have had the headphones 4 months and now they won't connect to Bluetooth. I also tried to connect them to a PC for an update but they will not connect via USB. I have tried to reset the headphones but that didn't work either. In contact with Apple Support now. This is my second pair of Beats and the other ones had to be sent in to be repaired because the right side stopped working.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I got these headphones 4 months ago and for the first two months, the were great. A couple of months in, I started to have some connectivity issues and the earpads started separating from the base. Then the rubber headband started to come off.
Finally, a couple of days ago, the headphones died completely. I charged them to 100% and the still won't turn on. I bought wireless Sol Republic headphones a couple of years ago and they worked fine until I lost them and had to buy new headphones. I got these Beats thinking they'd be an upgrade.... They're cheaply made sold at a ridiculous price. NOT AT ALL WITH THE MONEY. THEY ONLY LASTED FOUR MONTHS!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Hey, So I'm writing my review on 7/18/19. I just received my beats solo 3's in the mail, and I ordered the matte black version. I read the previous comments that stated that people got fake beats in the mail and that sucks. I can't speak for those people, but the pair I received is real. I watched a couple of youtube videos to validate if mine were real and they in fact were.

Just hoping this review helps in case someone read the previous reviews of this product from this seller and was having doubts. I definitely had doubts and was nervous about getting a new pair, but am definitely relieved that mine were real and new. Hope this helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"So I have had these bad boys for about 2 weeks now. Let me tell you they work great! They came in the mail brand new sealed with all the cords and case. These have been used for gym workouts and casual listening. They do become slippery when working out hard, so I would not recommend running with these. I was skeptical at first but I have bad no issues so far. Make sure to buy a hard case as well to keep them safe!! Stand by for a later update!

UPDATE:
Going on 2 months now and they are still running strong. I used them mainly for workouts, running, and plane rides. No issues that I can detect. These are worth the money!

9 month review!!! These are still amazing. No issues yet. Keep in mind these are beats and very fragile.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Be careful. These are advertised as new and sold by Amazon directly; however, when they arrived, they don't work at all. Did not pair initially, then once paired, it went back into pairing mode every 2-3 minutes and kept losing bluetooth. Would not turn on if it was not plugged in and would not do a software update. Contacted Apple for support and it turns out the serial number on the headphones do not match the serial number on the box they came in. Apple says according to the serial number on the device, they were purchased last fall and are NOT new and have already been reported as defective. I'm very angry after spending this much on headphones, I expect them to be new and defect free. Returning for a refund and will shop elsewhere.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these particilar set of headphones for my grandson on May 27,2017. He was so excited! He receieved the headphones on May 29,2017. Three weeks ago the headphones broke . I told him it would be no problem as we bought the Square Trade insurance. Imagine my surprise to find out there was no insurance, In my grandson’s excitement he may not have done so. Nevertheless these expensive headphones should not break in four months time. I saw on order site that there was no restution for this product as the allotted time had expired.
The outcome of the product has really bothered me. Thus this email. I want to warm people against buying these particular set of headphones especially with the Holiday season around the corner. My grandson is almost 15 years old and is a responsible boy with expensive “toys”. $200+ is a lot of money to end up throwing away.

"So sad, I really wanted to like these. I used to love Beats.
The GOOD - And as far as looks go, the are fabulous - I got the rose gold & they are one of the only headphone that I actual feel fashionable wearing.
And they fit my ‘girly’ head; meaning that almost all great headphones seem to be made for guys. Why is that?! Don’t girls want the fabulous sounding headphones too (rhetorical question). Thus these fit comfortably AND they don’t look like I’m about to pilot a helicopter, mow the lawn or on the tarmac directing airplanes.
To repeat - this look and feel awesome!!
Now the BAD - the sound quality is lame. What happened Beats?? Dre?
I’m guessing that these are made to appeal to a wide variety of listening tastes.
Yes, they are probably better than most headphones made for general call/cell phone use.
Oh also GOOD - they pair flawlessly with my iPhone 7. Easy as pie to set up. And they auto connect perfectly. Also, they seem to have a better than most headphones length of Bluetooth connection.
But I must go back to my original point - the bass and over all rich quality of sold is totally lacking. It’s not horrible but it’s like listening to music “lite”, good but not great. Kinda like eating fat frozen yogurt, it isn’t bad, but is it it Haagen-Dazs... not even close",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are not made for anyone looking to seriously exercise in them. After 6 months the fake leather covering the ear pieces came off from sweat and that is even with beats protectors on. It’s now June 2018, so they two month out of the one year warranty and they simply snapped in half when I was taking them off at the gym. I keep them in a hard shell case, not rough on them. They simply feel apart from exposure to sweat during workouts. I’m very VERY disappointed",2.0 out of 5 stars

"When they worked, the sound quality was good, and it didn’t take long to charge. I bought them in August (gave them to my daughter in September for her birthday), and the mic cord came apart almost immediately - the mic cover came off). By January 1st, one side didn’t work. We’d gotten her a set of wired Beats a few years ago, and she treated them very well. The leather wore out around the ears, but there wasn’t a scratch, and she insisted they were still perfect. Because she was so good with them and used them so much, we surprised her with these wireless ones. The problems with the mic and one side were not caused by damage. The glossy finish is still in perfect condition, and she is meticulous with her things. I’m just so disappointed in the quality. The wired ones we bought a few years ago (3 sets) still work; so I guess we won’t be upgrading to wireless anytime soon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"RETURNING!!!! I opened the box and the first thing I noticed was that the headphone case was cheap. I own a pair of the Solo 2 and the case is nice soft material. This feels like a cheap backpack from the dollar store. The biggest problem was the Bluetooth. I would connect to my phone and after only 5 seconds it would disconnect every time, even when I stayed close to my phone it still disconnected within seconds, after trying over 10 times, with 4/5 battery life. I am very disappointed in the company who sent me this junk. Never buying from these people again. Buy from Best Buy. I just saw that they are $10 cheaper, and more trust worthy, straight from the store. 1/10, 0/10 if I could. Buyers Beware!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Beats Solo3 is not the best audio out there, but the crazy thing is that I find myself wearing them more often than another $500 pair of headphones that I have just because they are so convenient and easy. They fold up small and are easy to carry in a backpack, holding up well to pretty tough treatment. The battery lasts forever and if it does die, you can get a whole study session of juice for like 5 minutes of charging. Connecting to my MacBook, iPhone, or iPad is so easy using the M1 chip and the syncing of settings through iCloud that it makes connecting other bluetooth devices seem super cumbersome: Just turn the Solo3 and choose it from your list of devices (no need to disconnect from one device before connecting to the next). And finally, they look good and are very comfortable.

So even though they aren't the best headphones I own, they end up being the ones I use the most because of how convenient, tough, long-lasting, and easy they are. Even though I said the sound isn't the best, the sound is great. The only time that I can discern that they are inferior is head-to-head, and even then, for some types of music these are preferred. They are certainly tuned to handle bass quite well, but they aren't overly bass-heavy as some other reviews indicate. So the sound is more than passable, quite good, and even superior for some music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"A lot of people always seem to nitpick about about the items that they purchase off of Amazon. They always talk about how the sound quality could have been better, they always somehow find a reason that they think it's good enough to complain about the comfortability. Here's what I think about the beats that I bought:

They are one of the best headphones a person can ask for. I do not understand why people tend to complain about the comfortability when they have cushions for your ears. That's what's really important when it comes to wearing headphones that goes over your head. The sound quality is exactly what you would expect from a popular company. The sound quality is amazing along with the different colors that you can buy. When I first bought my headphones I had a question mark over my head because it wasn't turning on, but that was only because it needed to be charged. And that is the beauty of Beats Solo 3, if your headphones is dead, you can also still play music with the wires, just simply plug it in your phone and in your Beats.
I do not know if it is just me because due to the fact that I lost my other pair of Beats it's been such a long time since I touched it let alone wear it, they do seem to feel fragile, all the more reason to place a warranty on an item that happens to feel fragile. Now the question that everybody seems to be asking is ""is it true that it only takes about 5 minutes to charge the headphones completely, and is it true that the battery life last up to 40 hours."" Well the answer depends on how much you use your headphones. There is 5 LED lights that indicates the percentage of your battery of the headphones. If the LED light is on the third light, that just means that you are at least 50 to 75% of battery life left so in other words, it would take a roughly 5 to 10 minutes to charge it which isn't bad. But ultimately it is pretty fast when it comes to charging headphones especially when it turns out to be Wireless. The volume button Works along with the pause and play button, the button that turns on the wireless headphones work. It even makes that musical noise when you are officially connected to your device, and it does it again when you turn it off. I am able to extend the headphones. I am able to fold them which is a definitely a must for me because when I am finished with my headphones for the day I usually fold them.

In conclusion, if something happens to your headphone such as a shortage on the right or left side of the headphones, if you have a warranty all you have to do is just call Apple and they should be able to fix it either call Apple or whatever warranty you are affiliated with. In addition, if you have a computer or a laptop you should download this beat app where you able to update the headphones, I will not go into details but you could always look it up on your spare time. With that being said I'm giving this product and five star and whoever purchase it in the future, I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy what you bought. Not to mention that this was on sale because originally it was $300. Now in the beginning of my review I was talking about how people tend to nitpick and and complain about things that can be easily fixed. And I was very serious about that, they are the ones who bought the item off of Amazon if something happens to that item it doesn't take as much to file a complain and get a refund and get your money back after you give them back what has been broken. Since a lot of people gave it a one-star, I had to double think about me buying this. But when I purchased it it turns out to be great just as I was expecting, no issues to the point where I would want a refund.

Oh and by the way, the true difference between Beats Solo 3 wireless and Studio 3 is that studio 3 have the ability to cancel out noise, solo 3 although you are able to increase your volume the point where you are not able to hear a single thing from the outside world, there is still a chance where despite your volume being all the way up the environment that is around you could be louder than your music. So it is not fully a noise cancellation headphones. But these headphones are beneficial for me because I'm not always in an environment that is loud enough to where I have to blast it up to 100.

And this is where my review ends",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Audio quality is amazing and the design is, of course, slick. However this is the second time I've made a Beats purchase, and I've decided I won't be purchasing anymore of their products. Maybe it's because I use headphones so much, but with both products, they lasted less than half a year before something went wrong. In this case, the cushion was coming apart, and I was having trouble connecting with my laptop several times. Sometimes it would disconnect out of the blue and I would have to restart my laptop to get it to connect again. They weren't very comfortable on my ears either, so I think I'd prefer an over-the-ear headphones because this one squishes down on mine. It's a shame because the audio really is amazing! And I love the design and color, but for this price, it's not worth buying, at least not for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Got 2 pairs at once for me and my girlfriend who use them all the time with our iPhones. I have an iPhone 7 and she has an iPhone 6. I love the new pairing tech apple has in the iPhone 7's and up and these headphones are just great. You can use wires if you want to, which I think maybe makes the base a little better, though I am not sure how accurate that is. Either way, I LOVE THESE headphones! One thing I am surprised about is the battery life on these things. I charge them once a week and often fall asleep with them on Audible and wake up to them still playing all night and still only charge about once a week. The battery life is amazing, the range is amazing, the weight and design, packaging and comfort is just all top notch. I thought the battery life might be due to the W1 chip in my iphone 7 which uses the same tech as the Air Buds, but my girlfriend who uses regular bluetooth with her iPhone 6 reports the same ridiculous battery life. She also says that she charges hers once or twice a week. These are easily the most comfortable beats thus far for over the ear. Head fatigue is almost non existent.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Item arrived on time and well packaged. This was my first ever Beats product and I absolutely love it. These headphones are much better in my opinion than either the Bose noise cancelling headphones or the Jabra headphones I have used in the past. Excellent sound with rich bass and easy to use functions. As others have mentioned these headphones do have a deep bass sound which I think is great. The re-chargebale battery is wonderful and I still have not had to charge them after a month of a fair amount of use. They even fold up to put into the little storage bag that comes with them. These headphones work particularly well with my Apple devices as there is an Apple wireless chip in them. These are great mid-range headphones for a fair price. Quite frankly, these are the best headphones I have ever had. I highly recommend them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Just a heads up, these are knock offs. Pieces were falling apart the second I opened the box so that was my original reason I started the return process. I had no experience with beats so after I decided to return them because they were falling apart I went to Best Buy and tried on a pair, when then I realized they were not the same thing at all. I’m really surprised amazon is allowing this. I didn’t believe the other reviews, I thought they had some accidental fluke. Nope, they’re completely fake and very cheap bad plastic. Save your money and your time. $20 ear buds would be a wiser purchase, or save a little more and buy the real thing.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound was good, but the ear piece part was small for my taste. It put a lot of pressure on the outside of my ears...it wasn't super comfortable. If you have large ears, you may want to try them on first. But sound wise, they were great.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Let me start by saying that I got Beats after they lowered the price to $150 (I think they were $300 or something like that before September 2019). If I had to pay $300 I'd probably send them back and try some other brands known for the sound quality (Bose, Sony). Anyway, for $150 I'm pretty happy with the purchase.
First of all, they are very stylish. If you're looking for a product with a cool design, you won't be disappointed. I personally like the way they look and it feels good to have them on. Beats are easily adjustable, not too heavy, overall they fit pretty well.
It's super easy to connect them to all Apple devices. iPhone, iPad, MacBook, you name it. I connect them to a few different devices and never have any issues.
Unfortunately, the sound is not that great. It's not bad but I personally don't see any difference between beats and regular AirPods. I was expecting more for $300 headphones. Also, I don't recommend using beats when you work out and move a lot (running, jumping, cardio exercises). Other than that I have nothing to complain about. I think they are worth $150 but this review would be way different if the price was 2x higher.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are great! They are authentic and come in the original packaging. I use them mostly to study (I listen to static noise) and I wear them during my runs. They fit a little snug, but that may be because I have a large head. They feel most comfortable without my glasses and earrings.
When I listen to music the sound quality is amazing. I put them on when I am cooking and it really puts me in the groove. My chef skills have definitely been enhanced following the purchase of these headphones. If you can't cook, buy Beats for some good eats!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This purchase was a part of my rookie intro into headphones. I travel about 80% of the time with my job, airborne, and was having a hard time finding headphones that were both compact and functional. I bought these on a whim during Amazon prime day - since they were on sale - and only wore them a handful of times. They are nice and have good sound quality, but after only 30 minutes of use, start to REALLY hurt your ears... Especially since they sit right on top of your ears. To put it into perspective - I am a petite framed female with normal to small ears. I imagine if they are uncomfortable on me (5’2 / Small oval shaped head) they would certainly be uncomfortable on most people. I ended up purchasing Bose QuietComfort 35. The price point hurt, but holy %*!@ has it been worth it. I can wear my Bose headphones all day (literally) with zero discomfort. Plus, you can remotely manage them with their app. My advice - spend the extra money and buy something else. Even my cheap pair of Sony headphones were more comfortable than the Beats. Not hating - hoping this helps.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Like many others, I read the reviews of all products and filter out the reviews I feel are retaliatory or based on a shipping/seller problem verses a product issue. BUT, in this case my biggest and only issue with the Beats Solo3 is the product! It's made from cheap materials and not as impressive as the marketing campaign that launched the Beats brand. They are made of flimsy plastic, the ear cushions are made of foam and pleather that becomes oily, have fit issues, fiction and performance problems and the additional heat they generate around your ears is astonishing (maybe i should use these while snowboarding)! I've had mine for 5 months and shocked on how many issues I've had so far. Some background, I buy A LOT of items through Amazon and other retailers (some people might say I have a problem, I say I have my PhD) and this one of the worst purchases I've made! Issues I've experienced so far include; won't charge, won't turn on, won't turn off, Bluetooth not connecting to an iPhone or the car, pleather ear covering ripped on the left ear, plastic sleeve housing left speaker broke and now held together with rubber bands (about to upgrade them to electrical tape though 👍🏼) now the entire left ear housing has broken and will also get the electrical tape treatment. DO NOT waste your money or PLEASE go into a store so you can see them for yourselves and you'll be prepared for what your getting. I wish I could still return mine......procrastination gets you every time!!!

"I keep it simple sounds good battery life is good they are comfortable I don't like headphones that cover my entire ear cause they make my ears hot and I cant keep them on for long periods of times so there not many options out there for on ear headphones really most of them are like studio headphones and the ones that are not they are not stylish, things I don't like much are they slip off my head every time I bend they are slippery they over price in my opinion the adjustable size looks cheap the open up just grabbing it by accident for me they are delicate headphone you got to be careful with them if you want them to last. so for me they are ok cause my options are limited and I bought this with a amazon gift card so it was more like a gift didn't use my own money.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I used to have the Solo 2 wired beats and, after many cable replacements, I figured an upgrade to the wireless would be my solution. After nearly a year without beats, considering my stubborn self didn't want to pay for yet another replacement cable, getting back to these was like heaven. They sound absolutely amazing, providing a wide range and and depth in the music. I barely put them up past half the volume and am just stunned by the quality. Even though the Solo 2 were already fantastic, they truly outdid themselves on the Solo 3.

My only issue, which I'm unsure if it's an issue for everyone or just me, is that the clip for the bag and accessories was rather loose and did not close correctly. This caused me to lose all of my accessories and the bag. Luckily I had been wearing the beats at the time so I didn't lose those but I was incredibly upset that I could have and did lose some stuff. However, Amazon support was great and solved the problem quickly.

All in all, I really love these headphones so much. They have a great feel and sound and the ability to go cordless is such a fantastic feeling.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these headsets to replace a set of in ear headsets (Mpow) that just never quite were satisfactory for use at the gym and for general use. Never thought an over the ear product would work for me until I read the reviews on these Beats Solo 3 by Dr. Dre. So I had to try them.
This is my initial unsolicited review after about a week. I have the matte black color, which sometimes Amazon varies in price to drive choice. I got mine at a good time, though- Cyber sales- so it was a very competitive price.
What did I expect going in? Before I opened the box (quite a package, if you're into that sort of thing!) had good confidence that the bass sound quality would be outstanding from reputation of the Dr. Dre Beats brand. Rewarded in that regard and many other aspects as well.
Besides that though, there is a wired connection cable, and a charging cable packed inside and all the 'foo-foo' packaging you might expect from Apple, just to mention accessories you might expect.
I'm going to concentrate on what most people buy a headset for. So let's get on to the important stuff:
• Sound quality. It's unlike and greater than 90% of the headsets I have used. As an audio engineer (my past life) I have used plenty. The size of the cups is not an unusual one if you wear a lot of headsets- just over the ear as opposed a full surround, found I prefer this style these days.
• Great build quality/design of the ear cups. Fit well and very comfortable. I can easily wear for an hour at a time. After that, they begin to feel warm-ish (read I want to take them off for awhile). Most of my wear is inside the gym, haven't gone outside for a run with them, may be different impression.
• Outstanding battery life. I got them at what appeared to be 100%, apparently they weren't though. On my iPhone (11 Pro) when I looked, the power read 50%. SO I thought to run them down to the ground. I put them on days later and it read 25%. Used further for a work out for 1.5 hours and still good (20%). Gave up and recharged 'em. I will report back on a running time after full charge.
• Isolation. An over ear headphone has MUCH BETTER isolation from external sound by it's nature of the cups surrounding the ear. I my opinion these headsets DO NOT need further noise cancellation, with the possible exception of air travel. Further noise cancellation would likely affect sound quality. Have not tried the noise cancellation version which is MUCH more expensive. I have a pair of Sony noise cancelling over-the-ear type headsets for travel that do not sound as good as these but cancel plane noise VERY WELL. The thing is, they don't sound as good.
• Controls and pairing to several devices. Bluetooth is flawless and fast to pair to new devices (admittedly all Apple). Controls on the headset (pause-play,volume up/down) are VERY responsive. I did find that going from one device paired to another always requires that the second pairing be connected at the device again. The headset want to stay paired to the original device until a new device is paired. Once you have that concept it's easy to switch between sources.
• Microphone on a call sounds great to the caller and the caller sounds great in the headsets. I don't know where the mic is exactly but wherever, it works!
Listening test. I'm listening to the headsets as I write this review. I enjoy music and my favorite sounds are nothing short of magnificent played on these headsets. My positives about that are fabulous bass (expected). My only criticism is the ""mushy"" highs. So I had to engage an equalizer to improve the highs for me. On Music app you can fool with the settings. I pictured what works for me and I admit to some hearing loss, so what it means to you is only that there is no actual reproduction of ultra low bass (<30-40Hz, I'm guessing) or ultrahigh frequencies (>12KHz), which I think is to be expected on these type headphones. What is there is fairly well flat but could use boosting (again for me) and tweaking in the mid-range high frequencies. I feel that resulted in a major improvement. In my case with known music as the source and still with a bit of bass coloration, I found a sweet spot, to EQ settings as shown in the picture.
Review conclusion. An outstanding quality product! If there 4.75 stars I would give it that overall rating. Actual Rating. I'm taking off 1 star overall for less than perfect sound, likewise the bass quality because it was too overpowering out of the box and affected the frequency response. Apple knows something about audio and many folks will disagree with me. OK. My fix was minor on the computer source. However the fix for iDevices is not as easy, though I'm betting there is an app for that or soon will be because it's worth doing.
I may just get that app and use it, because these headsets are a pleasure to wear and use.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love these headphones, we will buy another Beats Solo3 next month after we save up. A bit spendy as compared to Sony 950 set that we returned last week, but absolutely night and day difference in sound quality. The Sony set had superb bass, but there was a trade off as treble and midrange suffered quite a bit (lacking). These Solo3 have a very balanced and deep bass, as well as detailed midrange and treble. Probably the treble was a tiny bit lacking, but full treble can be harsh I have found. I was thinking my Planetronics Backbeat did better with overall sound but after listening to them again to compare, I found the Solo3 has the mid and highs covered better as it takes the ""harshness"" out of a lot of it. Kind of cuts off the harshness of not only the treble and mids, but also the bass . No overpowering bass, but totally enough to make me happy . Listen to a lot of dubstep, and these are very pleasant sounding with that genre of music !!

Folding them up to put in the carry case didn't feel like I was going to break them, which I was worried about before I purchased. For the price they can not be beat, very happy (oh did I say that already) ? lol",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Update January 18 2019
After having to have my beats replaced FIVE times in less than a year, a person in a higher position talked to me. He made sure I got a new pair of headphones AND a new warranty. I did send them in for a replacement two days ago, because the ear coverings had started coming off again and would not stay in with the card trick. So I had that done while it was under warranty. I know that these beats won’t last forever, I am currently seeking a better alternative for when that happens.

Let me first say, I love my beats. The sound is much better than the past beats headphones. But the build quality is horrible. I knew they didn’t have the best build, but the fact that I’ve had to have my solo 3’s replaced twice in less than a year is absolutely ridiculous. I take very good care of my headphones, I’m not rough with them at all. These are way too expensive for the quality you’re getting. At least apple has been helpful.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited a year to post a review as I wanted to see if they would last. Yes the sound is great. Yes the noise reduction is wonderful, but if they only last a year, they are not worth the price! I've seen comment after comment from Beats owners that after a year or less couldn't hear sound from one side. To have them repaired is $129. There are you tube videos showing you how to tear apart the faltering side and pull wires, solder and put it back together, but if you don't have the skill set, you're stuck with Beats that only have sound in one ear. Get a less expensive pair of headphones. You'll be so much happier if they break and you are not out $229",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I rearrange my home office recently. This office is my primary workplace. In the rearrangement, my computer hutch and my desk are on opposite walls. As I moved back and forth my old standby Grado SR60 cans ended up pulling out of the headphone jack or worse pulling the computer on the floor. I was looking at the Beasts solo 3 wireless as they seemed very similar to the Grados. The price was right on Prime day.

These are on ear cans so I don't expect perfect noise cancellation. That said the experience is better than expected. The sound excellent and very transparent. I can go from bass heavy rock to string quartets without needing adjustments. Wearing duration is very good, with two to three hours with fatigue. Learned not to bend too far forward or the headphones will fall off. Bonus finding, these headphones are very good for phone calls. I was listening when paired to my iPhone when I had a phone consultation. I forgot I was wearing the beats and when I realized I did not make the switch to my usual phone headset I asked about my voice clarity. I was told the call was very clear.
Finally, the pairing to my MacBook Pro and iPhone was very easy and switching between devices is just a matter of going the menu on the device I want use and selecting the Beats.

For the environment when I use these headphones they are exactly what I want. There tendency to slip off when bending and noise leakage make them a poor choice when I am woodworking.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I kicked around the idea of buying these after I got my iPhone X, which lacks an earphone jack. At first I didn't want to spend another couple hundred dollars after I'd just spent $1200 on the phone, but I bought these on impulse while waiting for a delayed flight last weekend. I am really happy I did. I didn't read any of the reviews until after I'd made the purchase so I was concerned for....say, 30 seconds that I'd get a fake. But let me say with absolute certainty: THESE ARE REAL. I feel bad for people who ended up with knock-offs, but I got what I paid for.

This is actually my second pair of Beats, since I've had the ""sport"" version for several years. No, those ones did not wear out - they're still going strong for four years now, but I got them to wear while training for marathons and running on the road where I wanted to be very aware of traffic and my surroundings. Since then, I've migrated more to lifting and wanted headphones that would block out outside noise and let me get into my zone uninterrupted. As a gal lifting by herself, the chatter from the ""bros"" on the weight floor is still a little intimidating to me but these Beats do just the trick to help me tune that out, pay attention to only what I am doing, but still have enough awareness of what's going on around me so that I'm not the rude one who looks like she can't share space and the equipment.

The battery life is much longer than I expected and probably does approach 40 hrs like the product description says. They came fully charged and I first used them on a Monday and think I probably didn't actually turn them off but the battery still had juice when I picked them back up on Wednesday. They are a little heavier than I expected, but still very comfortable. I am not a musician and can't weigh in on the nuances of sound quality, but I can say that my music sounds phenomenal in these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these headphones exactly two years ago today. They now experience random disconnecting and won't repair to an already paired iDevice. At first, these were awesome! The pairing experience with an iDevice is so fluid and seamless. Pairing it to any of your other iCloud-connected devices is so easy. I went from my iPhone to my iPad to my Apple TV all in a day. The battery life is also amazing. I think I went 4 months without charging it at one point. Fast forward to today and I am really disappointed. My Solo 3s started to disconnect in the middle of songs and it wouldn't repair. I tried everything, even resetting the device and forgetting it on my iPhone. That worked at first but that solution would only last a day. I contacted Apple Support and they offered to replace it for $129 plus tax. Now that sounds like a good deal at first, but consider that I already spent $300 on these 2 years ago. I expect these headphones to last at least 5 years. And I took great care of these headphones, they were never exposed to water, and I never worked out with them (they aren't water resistant!). I think I am done with Beats, and instead, I will now take my $129 plus tax and use it towards the purchase of a Bose or Sony headphones. Hopefully, they have better build quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"After purchasing Beats Solo 3's I attempted to buy AppleCare+ at the Apple Store within the 60 day window. Apple informs me that the ""purchase date"" was more than 60 days (in fact is was 120 days prior to my purchase date). Further, trying to get a US representative is nearly impossible. Instead you are placed on hold for more than thirty minutes only to once again being connected to a off-shore representative.

"Not at all worth your $300. Seriously I would not consider purchasing these ever again, especially after the lack of support I received from Apple on them.

I purchased these originally in November of 2017. In June of 2018 I had an issue where audio stopped working completely with one of the ears (I can't remember if it was the right ear or the left ear). I brought them into the Apple Store they looked them over and determined they could be sent in. About 10 days later I received the headphones in the mail, but it was never clear if they were mine or a replacement pair that I got back (if they weren't mine, why did it take so long, why not just give me a new pair right there in the store?).

Fast forward to now, May 2019. I'm having the same exact issue. The audio in the right ear has stopped working. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps they ask you to perform (try on multiple devices, try with the cable connecting it to a device, reset the headphones, etc.). I brought them into the Apple Store, this time I'm told that my only option is to pay $129 for a replacement pair. Apple will sell you a new pair (with only a 90 day warranty) for $129 since you previously purchased this product.

Apparently the original product has a 1 year warranty on it. The replacement/repaired product has a 90 day warranty or whatever is left on your original warranty, whichever one is longer. So at this point I'm outside that window. I connected with Apple Support today, this time online, to go through the same process to see if I could find any other solutions. Same result, I can purchase the replacements for $129 which will only have a 90 day warranty on them.

So two pair of these headphones got me from November 2017 to May 2019, a total of 18 months. I'm not sure how Apple can justify that it's alright for $300 headphones to be completely worthless after a total of 18 months. Considering I had two pair, so they seem to really last roughly 9 months. I will never buy another Beats product again and I'm disappointed that I already own so many other Apple products :(.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Contacted apple support and after shipping both out at a cost of $130 each to repair, they refused and simply told me to purchase new ones. Poor product and even worse customer service from apple.

"I believe these are the real thing and the packaging was perfect. They paired up perfect to my ipod but I don't know if they were defective but the volume is pathetic even at full volume... I can barely hear the music but I can hear everything else! Kinda bummed because I had heard some great things about them. They're beautiful and well made but my cheap wire earbuds that I was replacing blow them away... I'm glad I kept my cheap earbuds.

Now I'll go to maybe a Bluetooth earbud or wire system... Just something that has volume so I don't hear all the noise going on when I workout. Just want to hear the music and not what the people next to me are saying. So if you want volume and music when you're working out... You don't want these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Let me start with a couple things. 1) my phone that I use these headphones with is a galaxy note 8. 2) this is my first purchase of any set of headphones that cost more than 40 dollars so high end by my standards.
With that out of the way these are not all I was expecting for such a highly known brand. I have a pair of in ear wireless headphones with what seem to me about the same sound quality and for a tenth of the price. (They are 20 bucks). These are significantly better at noise cancelling which I can appreciate. However some things I have problems with besides the quality of sound is they are tolerable to wear for a period of time with glasses but after that period they can start causing a headache and just be extremely uncomfortable. With that said they do hold secure to my head and don't really move unless I'm moving my head a lot. I've been using them on and off for 3 days now and still haven't charged them (and they came with only a half charge at that) which is incredible to me. The other problem I have is it is extremely catered to Apple I believe. When in Bluetooth mode I had a difficult time connecting even with instructions, the volume up and down/ play pause button is a hit and miss whether it wants to work or not, and trying to go back a song does not work at all. It usually just skips 3 or 4 songs ahead. When it is connected via the wire the button on the wire is useless unless I need to pause and play. The volume buttons do not work and i cannot skip or go back songs. The final problem I had is the case. It is very limited in space which I can appreciate for on the go and packing in my backpack. However getting them into it's case can be much harder than is required.
With that being said, I do actually like these headphones and will keep them. They are a good pair of headphones. The negatives I've included have primarily been the biggest problems that I've run into.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"So i thought i had something wrong with my ears but nope it's the headphones. I've been wearing all kinds of headphones for long periods of time and I've never experienced headphones that would pinch your ears and give you an ear ache that you can't rest your head on the pillow because it's too painful. I've lost sleep, work concentration and money over these. Sound quality is better than other headphones I've used but none of those $40 headphones have ever made me loose sleep. Now I can't return them after using them for one month.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I realize that these are not inexpensive headphones. I wanted really decent headphones that had a really large bass response. Beats are known for their quality and so that's what I was looking for. Fast charging that will last for a long time, meaning that I only seem to need to charge it every few days, and I use it a lot. Also very beautiful. It has invisible controls on one side of the headset, meaning that if you press one of the sides things will happen, like volume control, and most importantly, if push twice it will skip to the next song depending on how you have your source music set. I have mine set to play randomly so I don't know what is playing next. That is controlled by your unit, not the headphones. These are Bluetooth headphones and you can hook them up to anything that Bluetooth's. It also has an incredible range on it. This is my second apartment I have had them at and it actually goes perfectly from floor to floor right through the cement without sound deterioration of any kind. No I don't know what the range is, and so it may depend on your own situation, but I simply do not think that there are better headphones out there for the price. Like I said, if you are looking for excellent bass response, and I like bass, because I listen to a lot of rock 'n roll and heavy metal, then these headphones are the right ones to get. They are also very sturdy and they fold up so if need be you can put them in your coat pocket. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had these since August 2017 and I loved them but I've noticed in the last few months, they don't seem as great. I feel like some songs are fuzzy suddenly and now like tonight, they just keep, for a lack of better word, stopping; the song will stop and I'll check the connection, it is still connected and the song is playing on iTunes, but there is no sound. I'll pause the song, push the little button on the headset, then push play on iTunes and they'll be fine again for a while. And then some nights I can't get them to work at all.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"So the first thing to know about Beats is that they are optimized/equalized before you buy them. You cannot equalize Beats. That's their whole selling point is that you dont need to. Now having said that the question must be asked ""is this a good thing?"" And the answer is, to some degree at least, yes. These headphones are extremely well made and durable and the sound quality is by far the best I've heard yet. The battery life is insane. They advertise a 40 hour battery life at a full charge and up to 3 hours of battery life with just 5 minutes of charging. As far as I can tell these numbers are lower than the actual battery life as on my first full charge i didnt need to charge them for almost a month all while listening to them 4+ hours a day for at least 5 days a week. The only issue with these headphones is these are really made for rap/hip hop. Now don't get me wrong, I have listened to metal, country, pop, classic rock etc on them and it still sounds extremely good, but hardcore audiophiles may not like the inability to equalize the headphones themselves. All in all these are by far the best headphones I've ever owned and definitely are worth the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones have decent sound quality for 1) bluetooth and 2) casual listening. They are on-the-ear style that come with a 3.5mm cable (for plug-in listening and full audio quality), a nifty carrying case. What I enjoy, however, is the pairing with Apple devices via their W2 chip. I recommend these for people with Apple devices (particularly if you have more than one). If you aren't an Apple user or have a mixed ecosystem, check out Sennheiser's HD series for better options.

As they are ""on-the-ear"" phones, you may experience fatigue after several hours. By that point, giving your ears a break (for any headphones) for a few minutes will be helpful.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Ladies & Gents this Review is best suited for those share the same interest in the following questions.
1) Is it Loud Enough?
Absolutely...., Beats by Dre now uses Apple Tech in their HeadPhone lines, held by Strong Standards giving you quality sound and durability......Read On-->
2) is It Worth the money ?
You pay for what you expect not for what you want... , They are Made for the Every Day User with Great Quality Materials and of Course Performance
3)Gloss Black Vs Black?
These are GlossBlack with look great they really are made of good materials and although it has a beautiful glossy black finish to it , its not that annoying super shiny 'sprinkling gloss'

I owned the previous model the Wired Solo 2's wich I did Enjoined but didn't fill my expectations on Quality ... The Solo 3's changes all that....
With High Quality Output Sound, Long Lasting Battery Life, and made of Great Quality materials you have everything you need in the box and the HeadPhones already come with a full charge ..... I gotta be completely Honest and say I have had them for half a day at the time of this review and wanted to write an informative review on my experience .... the quality of hd sound and battery life for daily use ... some up in One word AMAZING!!!....40 hours of battery life after a single charge or 3 hours after a 5 min. charge ...Great Quality Sound and what looks to be made of great lasting material .... Get!! I like the head phones not to mention how quickly it connects to your iPhone , now I also own an Apple Watch and was always pleased on the seamless experience of the bluetooth connectivity ...the Solo 3's give you the same experience ... giving cordless a new meaning.....

After almost 6 months of Normal Use Left Headphone gave up ( no sound) Lets see if we are covered .....",4.0 out of 5 stars
"The Basics -
Build quality: 8/10
Sound quality: 7/10
Comfort: 7/10
Battery: 10/10
Usability: 8/10

I'm going to start with the build quality, which I think is excellent. Everything from the packaging to the ear pads is looks and feels well constructed. The design of the headphones is also very simple, so there is not a lot of variation in texture/materials, which gives the headphones their slick and stylish look. The only thing I wasn't very impressed with was the soft shell carrying case, which is only okay. It's good for keeping the headphones from getting tangled or caught on stuff in a bag or pack but offers very little actual protection.

Sound quality: 7/10
For on-ear headphones, the sound quality is pretty good. But at the price point, there are other headphones you could get that have better sound quality. That being said, these definitely perform well and I enjoy listening to them.

Comfort: 7/10
As with pretty much any on-ear headphone, these do start to get uncomfortable to wear after a while. However, I find that I can wear them a good 2-3 hours before they start to get tiring on my ears. I also find that I rarely use them for that long, as when I'm at work or somewhere I'm sitting, I probably won't be using these. So they're great for traveling, around the yard or house, at school, etc, but probably not a primary headphone.

Battery: 10/10
The battery on these is amazing. I believe the battery is listed for 40 hours of use, and I would say that's about accurate. I have yet to have the battery die,

Usability: 8/10
The power button is small but easy to locate, the headphones connect super fast to my phone (almost instantly), and the play/skip and volume controls are accessible and easy to navigate without any thought.

Overall I've been super happy with these and would recommend them to any looking for a stylish and good sounding pair of school/travel headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are very good headphones, but for the steep price, I was a little disappointed. Main points:

1. SOUND QUALITY: This is the most important part of the experience and this is the downfall of the Solo3. The base is too overwhelming, resulting in an overall muddy sound. I was actually quite surprised at how bass heavy these were the moment I first turned them on. Mid range and tenor sound tight and crisp without flaws, but its simply a bit over weighed by the intense bass. Of course this is a subjective determination...but count me in in the ""this is too much bass"" group.

2. WEAR: These are a bit heavy, more so than an accompanying pair of wired headphones, but the weight in itself is not intrusive. The headphones fit tightly, but after some time the ear pads do slightly pinch my lower earlobes. Its not a deal breaker, but again, I was expecting something engineered flawlessly for comfort for the price.

3. CONNECTIVITY / BATTERY LIFE: Excellent coverage on these for blue tooth. I can walk almost up to 10 meters away in a different room before these start fritzing out. A huge plus is the very long battery life. As I listen to music at work non-stop, I was sick of having to recharge headphones every 5-6 hours or so. I charge these once and they last several days and into the weekend as well sometimes.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I recently re purchase beats solo 3 black hoping for a great experience. Out of the box everything was great and working without any issue. Travel to San Francisco didn’t have any issue. On my return trip back to my home state I experience charging issue with the beats solo 3 headphones where the battery would not take a charge and stayed on red. I tried different cables and used an ac to USB charger still same results. I stop by apple and they would have to send it out for two weeks I was still under 30 day purchase period and had them returned. I waited and purchase another pair recently hoping for a great experience worked great no issues until today. My headphone were charging all night with no issue 5 white lights. Went to the gym notice it was at 3 white light s strange. 1 hours of working out the headphones stop working. Stop by apple they said try to reset and charge again if issue continue they would send it out for service two weeks. Came to the office and attempted to reset and charge my beats solo 3. The unit would not charge pass 1 white light for 2 hours. There seems to be issue with beats solo 3 not sure what it could be but I will wait before purchasing again.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Beats are great when it comes to sound quality, mobility and battery life. The design is beautiful, they fold compactly and come with an aux cable so they can be used plugged in to things such as console controllers, monitors, laptops etc. The connectivity with my iPhone is great and the bluetooth range is impressive ( I was able to leave my phone on one floor of the house and go in to the basement and did not lose connection.) There are two down sides to these headphones however, the somewhat fragile folding system and the clamping weight. Basically you fold the headphones over on to themselves to store them and it seems like you can easily break them this way if you aren't careful. The clamping weight is the pressure these headphones put on your ears while they're on. After anywhere between 20-40 minutes of use, I usually have to take them off and readjust them to ease ear soreness. The heavy clamping weight helps these headphones stay on your ears however while moving around/exercising but unfortunately hurts your ears a lot.

Pros:
- Great mobility
- Great connectivity
- Great sound quality
- Great battery life

Cons:
- Fragile design
- Clamping weight (hurts ears over time)
- Price (if looking for budget headphones or if you don't get them on sale like I did)

Hope this review helps.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not an audiophile but husband is and currently own real great sounding headphones. I've got this ship n sold by amazon and it's 100% authentic and was able to register. We're not an apple household and I only bought this out of long time curiousity and it's battery life.
Coming from Sony and other high end brands, this beats is not really that special audio wise. The bass is good but it is too bass-y for my liking I find it annoying sometimes. It sounds great in upbeat songs because of heavy bass but too muddy and noisy in mellows. I am more into soul, jazz, classical, pop, country, acoustic, 70s 80s classics and the likes so this isn't my go to headphone. I cannot stand this headphone when it comes to slow songs. When I'm in a mood for some upbeat reggae then this is it.
It's overall nice quality, sound is good, just not $200 let alone 300 good. People saying this is the best in market probably never tried the really good ones out there (and it's okay). Glad I bought this at a deep sale price or I'd be crying by now. My $100 Sony & Bose sounds just as good and even better and clearer on most songs in my list. If we have same taste in music, look for something else, you'll find some with same sound quality but at a significantly lower price. And if you want to buy this, do yourself a favor, buy this on sale coz it's really not worth it's regular price. It's only worth $150 tops and that's already a stretch. If you've never owned expensive headphones and been saving $ to buy one then please look somewhere else: sony, bose, audioTec, bowers, beyerdynamic, sennheiser.
I'm keeping this not because of the sound but for my upcoming long international travel. I needed something that will survive me forever without charging since I'll be in the airport and plane for 2 days. The battery life is aweeesome- best out of all my bluetooth headphones!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are the real deal. Once I turned on the Bluetooth on my phone the Beats Solo software automatically appeared. It seamlessly connected to my Apple Watch as well. The Matte Black comes with grey lettering on top which also indicates that it is real. The sound is nice and crisp, especially with some old school Metallica. The headphones feel extremely comfortable, sturdy and light.

"It might seem harsh to ding the headphones for a software issue, but the reason you're paying a premium on these headphones is for the W1 chip, which makes it integrate better into the Apple ecosystem. If you're on android, there are better quality headphones for the price.

The W1 chip does let switching between apple devices work seamlessly, but the new iOS update (that I understand they have no intention of fixing) makes these completely unusable. I had to dismiss this popup 50 times a day whenever my headphones are near an iOS device. This happens on a device that's currently connected OR NOT. And when it's not, there's not even an option to connect. I have to dismiss this dialog in order to manually connect.

This is not a seamless experience. If I open my phone I want information quickly, I don't want to be reminded that my headphones exist. Do Not Disturb mode doesn't even and this misery.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Amazing headphones, I use them to do transcription and I am able to hear every single word without the strain or difficulties I had with previous headphones. The color is gorgeous and I love that it came with a case, cords and even a clip to put on the bag for when I'm traveling. The soft inner cushions for the ears are superb and very comfortable. I was worried that the white would be difficult to keep clean or would not look good but once I received them I saw that this would not be an issue. Controls on the headset are very easy to use, quick to connect to computer, laptop or cell phone and the sound quality is superb. I am very pleased with these amazing head phones and they truly are worth the splurge.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Overpriced. You can either buy for the beats name or spend half the amount of money and get something equal, if not better quality. These will break easily due to being made of cheap material. Then if you try to fix them yourself, you will need a whole set up (Soldering kit, replacement parts, and a steady hand). You’ve been warned.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Recently purchased these and have owned them for about a month. Love them and the sound quality for the most part; however, the left half of the headphones have completely blown out without warning, so now only the right side is producing sound.

"I'm not a headphone expert and maybe I was expecting there to be a live concert in my ears but these haven't wowed me in the slightest. The ear cups are small and can get pretty uncomfortable how they sit on your ears, the sound is just ok. Not bad but like I said, I got just as good of a sound from a less expensive pair and to top it off, they pull my hair out every time I take them off. With everything considered, I wouldn't buy them again. I'm giving them to my kids and whatever happens to them, happens. I should have stayed with my less expensive brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars

So aggravating they do not work like they used to and have failed to the point of my having to return.

"First review, more reviews to come the longer I wear This head set.
Wore them to the gym, they did not shift in any direction while wearing them. I wear glasses, I placed then just below my upper earlobe, no year pain after an hour in the gym.
Sound was great, kept it at 3/4 volume, was just the right level to get going, but low enough to hear if someone was trying to tell me something.
Quality feels good and durable.

"These headphones did not disappoint. There is not one bad thing I can say about them. Great quality. Great sound. I had no problem pairing them to my iPhone and MacBook. And yes, THEY ARE AUTHENTIC. I would suggest avoiding buying them from third party sellers, I believe that is why some people are receiving knockoffs. I would also suggest avoiding buying used Beats. Buy them new if you want to be sure you receive the authentic ones. For some reason the (white and gold) Beats were $30 cheaper when I bought them... they went up in price the day after I purchased them. If you happen to see them for a great deal, don't hesitate to buy them. If you're still worried about getting a knockoff, you can always price match at Best Buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones arrived today. After wearing them off and on throughout the day, I have enjoyed their quality in materials and the sound quality is great. I was worried that they'd be heavy on bass, but they're a good balance. I've listened to several genres of music and even some podcasts and the quality is consistent throughout all areas. My only complaint is that these headphones are not comfortable to wear for extended periods. After 30-45 minutes, they start to hurt becuase they put a decent amount of pressure on my ears. This is kind of a bummer because I bought these to use while doing online classes and school work.
*update*
I was working at my computer while listening to a podcast on these headphones. I had to use the restroom, I was able to walk all the way upstairs and listen to the podcast while doing business without any interruption! The distance on these things is ridiculous!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I'll start by saying I had a hard time finding genuine Beats online, if you search online you quickly learn what to look for. These were a bit less than retail, so I wondered if I'd be getting an authentic pair. It was indeed authentic (Mickey's 90th Anniversary Solo3 Beats).

The headphones are gorgeous, they make me smile. The sound is definitely fantastic. I had heard mixed comments on the Beats sound quality, but I spent this morning switching between the Beats Solo 3 and Bose QC35 and I honestly prefer the Beats sound quality. Of course, the QC 35 have perfect noise cancellation, but the Beats never claim to be noise-cancelling.

My only complain about the Solo 3 is that they are on-ear as opposed to over the ear. This means the cushions rest directly on top of your ears and I found that they became a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours of continuous use. I don't know if I'll get used to it, or the cushions will soften/adapt more to my ears. But for prolonged listening, right now, I would prefer an over-the-ear pair.

I'm overall happy with the purchase and I think most people will be too.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"As you can see I have a variety of different pairs and these are the best sounding, most comfortable pair I own. Synced easily with my iPhone, and work perfect with my Series 1 Apple Watch music controller. I wasn't worried about the sync being an issue. They are so comfy even with my 3/4 size gauges, with them being metal it doesn't push them into my neck like some headsets do. They don't slip around either. They cover my entire ear and make a nice ""seal"" I guess you could say. Literally if they are turned up even to half the max volume I can't hear anything around me. Definitely would recommend them to anyone. I got them when they were $179 had some gift cards and such so I got a great deal on them, Amazon definitely has the best prices on these keep and eye on it if you aren't looking to drop the $300.

I’d been using a cheaper (yet prettier) set of over the ear headphones but they would start to feel tight after a bit, didn’t have wireless/Bluetooth option, and the sound was tinny. Now i totally get the big deal about these! They’re light weight, simple to use, the sound is AMAZING, they blocked out ambient noise like a BOSS, and are so so comfortable.

If that is the case, I would rather buy another brand that will hold up.

"Pros
Amazing 40-hour battery life
Good, clear sound on iphone7 from all audio sources (music & other audio playback apps such as YouTube)
Decent call quality for user and caller (unsure of performance in noisy backgrounds or windy conditions)
Good volume range for audio playback and phone calls
Decent noise canceling ability without integration of electronic noise canceling technology (I think ear cups are manually designed for optimum noise canceling)
Cord with high-quality mic provided with headset
USB charging fcable included (able to use iPhone wall charger or other compatible USB wall charger to charge headset as well as charging from connection to PC)
Only 2 hours charging time for full battery life
Comfortable ear cup padding
Headset controls not flimsy and easy to operate
Unbroken long-range Bluetooth connectivity using iphone7
Steller support for software updates, Bluetooth connectivity, and support questions (Beats products are owned and supported by Apple company)
Easy setup and installation with iphone7 (unsure of performance with Mac or Windows PC)

Cons
Some notable trouble using headset to answer mobile calls as well as soft phone calls (skype, what's app, etc.)
Very tight fit (tight squeeze on head causing frequent headaches, though diminished a slight bit after frequent use)
No voice feedback when operating controls (battery life can only be determined by viewing indicator LEDS; troublesome for blind user)
Strangely, no headset battery indicator on iphone7 status bar (many other bluetooth headsets show battery status next to Bluetooth indicator on iPhone status bar)

Well, as you can see, I've experienced a mixed bag of positive and negatives in using this headset. Here are some additional observations based on my experience.

* Though I'm not an experienced audiofile, the bass seems full without distorting other sounds. I experienced enjoyable audio quality when watching TV apps, youtube videos, and listening to music.
* My main purpose for trying this headset was for phone call quality by comparing them with the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series. I did experience fairly clear feedback from callers when using the headset, but callers sometimes reported a bit of distortion from my end but it was only slight. Additionally, I had frequent occurrences where, after receiving a call, I could not answer with the headset when trying to use them to answer the call. Instead, the call was routed to the iPhone itself and I had to manually route the call to the headset.

An Interesting Experience to Note

However, the strangest anomaly occurred when using this headset. From reading reviews and talking with Apple support, I was told, definitively, that this headset does not have a built-in mic when being used wirelessly (accompanying cord does have built-in mic). However, I successfully used the headset using Bluetooth connection (not with cord) and callers could hear me with no trouble. So, I reasoned that if this Beats headset doesn't have a built-in mic, then my iphone7's mic is being used to communicate with callers. However, after moving over 100ft. from my iPhone, the callers could hear me as clearly as when I was less than 5ft. away from the iPhone. So, I really don't know how my voice is being transmitted to callers when I'm communicating wirelessly with this headset. hmmm!

* In addition to trouble in answering calls with this headset, my main beef with this Beats product is the really tight squeeze on my head. Unfortunately, this tightness was quite uncomfortable to the point where I dealt with several headaches. Though I've only had these for 3 weeks, the discomfort has only diminished slightly.

Frankly, because I find the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series to have superior call quality on both ends and to be much more comfortable than these, I will most likely return this headset though it consists of many good features such as seamless connectivity with the iPhone and amazingly high battery life.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"We got these on Black Friday which made them an excellent value. Overall, these headphones are very comfortable and above average from a sound quality standpoint. There are many cheaper options out there, many of which I have tried, but I think that these are really a step up. The other great thing about these was the iphone bluetooth integration which makes pairing very easy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
My first pair lasted less than a year before they started giving problems. Battery life started decreasing. Then the led on/off light wouldn't turn off so it began draining the battery. So sent it in to be repaired thru warranty company. Well they sent it back in worse condition. Headphones went dead after 3 days and would not recharge. I also found damage on the right earpiece that looks like it was preyed open with a flat head screwdriver. So I informed warranty company again and then called amazon. The rep from amazon was really cool. Said not to worry we are sending you a brand new pair instead. Love how amazon takes care of the problem better than aftermarket warranty company.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased the Beats for my daughter and she loves them. This is the second set of Solo3's I've purchased for her. The left speaker failed on each pair. I've done research on the internet and learned that Beats has a problem with the left speaker failing due to a small wire being pinched during production. Unknown if this is the problem with the Beats I've purchased. The second pair I sent back for repair and am still waiting for them to be returned. Apple/Beats needs to address this problem immediately. Amazon has been great with their fast response to assisting us with sending them back for repair, however we were told ten days. It's been longer than that. Thanks",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are...petite, I guess would describe it. They're on-ear, and even when extended fully the headband clamps them on to your head with a tenacity worthy of something from the first Alien movie. My ears can't take more than about 20 minutes before the aching and lack of blood circulation force me to take them off. Haven't encountered this with other on-ear headphones before - the first step in using headphones is actually leaving them on your head, and when that's not really possible, all other considerations pale in significance.

That said, the sound quality is OK, but not great. These sound better than previous Beats headphones, so Beats is definitely improving, but for the price, there are better sounding headphones. These headphones don't overemphasize bass as much as older Beats headphones did, but it's still a bass-heavy headphone. If you want to hear treble and mid-range, there are cheaper headphones that will deliver them more effectively.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a replacement my cheap $25 bluetooth headphones. What a world of difference. Every genre of music sounds fantastic. They are a bit heavy but you get used to the weight. The controls are on the side of the headphones and are easy to use. They pair very easily with Apple products and even with Android products. I found there was a bit of delay with the signal for Kindle HD 10 but I had that same problem with my old headphones. However, the trouble didn't last long. I wore the headphones on a long 2 mile walk and although my ears got warm they did not sweat profusely. I wouldn't use them for a hard workout though. I wish the ear cups were a bit bigger because while I was walking there was a bit of pressure on my ears. They are great for sitting at home and even some light housework. The range is decent but the signal will start to break up around 500 feet away. I would recommend an arm band for your phone or mp3 device if you would like to walk around the house with them and still have good signal. They reduce a lot of exterior noise so they could be good on an airplane or library.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Purchased these head phones under 2 years ago. They are in great condition. Very little use of the past 2 years. They stopped taking a charge months ago. Finally got around to contacting Apple support about the issue. The one year limited warranty did help Apple would not replace the defective Beats Solo headset. Very disappointed with their service and not willing to stand behind their products. Recently my son had a issue with wireless Bose headset. The covering came off due to wear. They too were about 2 years old and out of warranty. Bose support send him a shipping label and replaced the headset free of charge. I'm a Bose customer for life.

"I’m primarily comparing the beats I own to DNA monster headphones I purchased at sharper image. DNA put the beats to shame in sound quality, the quality of materials is equivalent, whereas the beats win in terms of battery.

Here is the problem; why in the world would beats be so popular if their sound quality lacks severely? My answer: Dre, and the fact that they are just cool and come in rose gold (in my case). The battery typically does last a Day, which I gotta say I love. The fact that they auto pair nicely with my phone is great too. I would recommend over-ear beats if you just have to spend the money tho, on ears do get uncomfortable. If I could do it over again, I would have lefts these overpriced headphones on the shelf.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"They are so tight on my head I an unable to wear or use them -- they pinch and give a terrible headache. Also, if you wear them to workout or even walk, everystep reverberates into the ears. They are awful and they won't let me return.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I’ll get to the point.

Pros:

- Noise cancellation is superb. Nothing should disturb your music sessions with these on.

- Bass is adequate. Not earth shattering but good enough for a former bass head who had 10 inch subwoofers in my old Acura :-)

- Battery life is great. Didn’t have to charge these things for days.

CONS:

- Decibels could be louder. I tried these at max volume on all of my devices and was disappointed. Max volume should have your ears ringing but not the case here.

- mid range cords and vocals are lacking.

- The case requires effort to get the headphones inside. It should be effortless.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I have no complaints! Came in original box with everything as described. I’m not a headphone connoisseur and haven’t owned any others comparable to these so I can’t speak to how they measure up to others. I had been told they were of good quality so I got them, and I have enjoyed them so far. Easy to set up, and the charge lasts a long while. If you wear them for hours on end, your ears do get kind of sore, but i would expect that for any type of headphone like this. Does a pretty good job blocking out surrounding noise. We shall see if they stand up against the test of time and are worth the cost.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these for my daughters birthday. I gave them to her yesterday. I ordered them on Amazon Prime day so the window for returning was August 18th. I assumed ( hoped) they would work directly out of the box. My daughter was so excited to get these and they don't work! One side of the headphones is silent. I am SO DISAPPOINTED and am wondering if perhaps they sent out faulty ones on Amazon Prime Day? I did not buy the warranty because I assumed these were high quality headphones that would work if taken care of. I guess I learned my lesson about buying something and holding onto it for a gift at a later date. :-(,1.0 out of 5 stars
I have 2 pair of these and both stopped working via bluetooth after about a year. If you google beats stop working in 1 ear you will see all kinds of reviews.

"I had this unit for more than a month before returning it. Right off the bat, I didn’t like the controls being on the left side. Most people are right handed. Why put the controls on the left? Not only that but the functional layout of the controls were a little confusing. The power button (located on the right, go figure) was so tiny. I couldn’t locate the stupid thing after I had already put the headphones on. I felt like I was reading braille. I could not adjust it comfortably on my head, especially in the gym, in a good position w/o it falling every so often. I’d like to think I have a normal size head. On the plus side, the range (at least 60 ft.) and battery life (with 2/3 hrs of use per day could last a week w/o charging) was excellent. Oh, I liked the red/black combination of colors.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Finally decided it was time to throw away my old head phones since they were basically being held together by tape. Caught these on sale during amazon prime day.

The sound quality is great, legit cant hear anything but music when I'm wearing them.

"As a music lover, I could not wait to purchase my first pair of Beats. Getting the most out of music has always been a big thing for me. After saving up for months, I was finally able to purchase a pair of the Beats Solo3, only to find that after a short three months, the wrapping around the earpieces had begun to detach. After paying $230+ for these earphones, I was severely disappointed on the quality. If you do decide sink this much money into these, make sure to get a warranty.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Received these today. Genuine, brand new product in factory packaging. I had the solo2 for a long time and have been pretty rough on them, gym sweat finally killed them. So I’ve read many reviews and have owned several pairs and have come to a few conclusions. They have probably the best sound of any headphones I’ve tried, they are pretty tough and I’ve used the Apple warranty before for a broken set, they just sent me a new pair. With my past experience and what I put these through I decided to buy the 2 year extended warranty for $24, total purchase was $179.

"These headphones, like other beats products, have great quality not just in sound, but the design and everything that comes with it. The headphones are amazing to tune out from your surroundings and just jam out to whatever you like and not worry about missing a call or taking out your phone to adjust the volume or pausing your music or video. Everything is there on the left side phone to make your life easier. My only problem with these headphones is the On the ear design, Your better off getting Studio 3's if you're looking for comfortability while wearing these. Over long periods of time they start to hurt your ear and for instance, let's say you are laying in bed, u can't necessarily wear them while laying on your side, the only position u can wear them in bed is to face up. either way, these headphones are good, the only downside is to how long you can endure their uncomfortability that's all.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"overall, if i could go back and not buy this, i would. this is more of a brand type head set, i don't believe it's worth what you're getting. i've been told you can get some for 150 that sound better than this, and i'm looking into it myself. i feel cool walking around with this expensive head set, and i suppose it's not horrible, but as for someone who is not blessed with money, i would say don't waste your money if you're expecting $250 quality, i would say these are worth about 150 instead. battery life is amazing, a 5 minute charge can last me hours, and i can listen an entire week for several hours on a full charge with out needing to charge again. i give these a 3 because there is good qualities, but the price is just a deal breaker for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I’ve been rocking old school wired Bose QC’s for years (and never write product reviews). As a frequent traveler I rely heavily on my Bose Noise Cancelling “capabilities” - not something these Beats really have. That said, I paid $130 for this lil set-up on Prime Day - fantastic deal. A “whole” day into wearing them and I’ve got to say it just may have been the best $130 I’ve ever spent (heck, they could fall apart tomorrow for all I know). First, I’m really kicking myself in the butt for not going wireless sooner - I’m always snagging the wires on something and popping the wire plum out). Wireless is so liberating!!! The range on these things is incredible. I’ve got a pretty big house and I haven't found a reasonable area where the signal poops out (w/o curling up in a closet upstairs w/ my ipad in the garage). Second, the sound - crisp, clear and plenty loud. I’ve not taken them off since getting them - No doubt that’s going to agitate my wife:). Admittedly I’ve always been a Bose fanboy (not an audiophile though) and dismissed Beats all together as “just another shiny object w/ a great marketing angle”. My kids of course only wear Beats and tell me how much of an old man I look like with my wired Bose phones. Finally, battery life “if as advertised”. I’ve got about 12 hours on these guys so far which already impresses me:). The only “Cons” (it applies to most on-ear phones) are Noise in - they're not Noise Cancelling nor are they advertised to be / and Noise out - I’ve been listening to these things a fair bit louder than I do with my other headphones - when I take them off I notice how loud they are potentially to those around me (going to need to keep the volume at a reasonable setting I suppose). These things rock though - I keep finding myself dancing around the house and I’m no dancer. Get a pair, you wont regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Used them for couple months. They died like 4 months ago. Won’t charge, won’t turn on, only one side works when using aux cable. During the the time they did work they were great. Came in original beats packaging. Everything included. Got them during a daily deal so it was a great price. These are my second pair of beats. First were mixrs from Best Buy so I know they’re the same beats value. BUT After multiple cables I contacted Apple. Was thankfully still under warranty. Currently shipping for repair. Hoping it’s covered. I was skeptical about buying something like this on amazon. But if it’s a factory issue I would defiantly change my rating to a 5 because as of now I’m not sure what the issue is. I have read that solo 3s do have a lot of issues.

"I've gone through a handful of over the ear headphone throughout the ears, always trying to save a few bucks. I finally splurged on these babies and it's my greatest purchase of 2019. My main use is for traveling, I can't ever sleep on planes or in airports and with these little monsters, I'm sound asleep in minutes. Half the time, I don't even put on music, I just ""activate"" the super power of noise cancelling and it's like magic. I do use them while at work and even after I've had them on for hours, they're still comfortable. For conference calls, I've noticed that the quality of input sound is much better than my airpods and I have never had any clients complain that I'm hard to hear. FIVE THUMBS and A MILLION STARS!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is fabulous. I purchased these for my husband after he kept taking mine! The most impressive feature is that they work great on your phone. I talk to clients using my beats each day and they work perfectly. Clients comment on how well they can hear me AND I can hear them crystal clear. Not only that but they are extremely comfortable whether using at the gym or for work.

"Bought this product twice. Once in 2017 and again in 2019. The first pair fell started falling apart after 3 months (headphone material). The second pair lasted a few days over the 1 year mark and although this time they didn’t fall apart the power LED won’t shut off.

I tried all the different methods on their site and what others suggested doing, but nothing worked. I contacted beats support and they said I was out of the limited service warranty period so I would need to pay $129 to have them fixed or replaced.

I bought my first pair at $200+ and the second pair at $150 and now they want another $129 to fix a problem that seems to be an ongoing issue with their product due to poor construction. Aside from that, they sound good, which is why I feel inclined to give 2 stars, but based on my experience with these headphones that’s as much as I’m willing to rate it due to poor construction and warranty services.

If you’re going to buys these make sure to get an extended warranty or purchase them at Apple with AppleCare.",2.0 out of 5 stars
My son got these for his birthday. He loves them so much! He always has them on his head and loves the wireless feature. He can have his phone at one end of the house and go all the way to the other end of the house and it is still connected. He had an issue setting it up. You hit the button for 1 second for apple phones and 5 for android. The battery last a long time. He normally charges it at night but it last all day and isn't dead at night when he goes to charge it. The sound is incredible and it is so soft and light weight on the ears and head.

I never dropped the headphones, never use them while on the gym, to be in contact with water, but still.

"Everyone. Please do not buy any product from Beats. All beats products are made from China from really cheap materials and other things in the making of the product.

Would you rather look for well-known brand or for quality headphones, proven to work and perform outstandingly? And these other outstanding products are even cheaper than Beats. Why, because the price for Beats is an unreasonable price. The Beats are not worth that price because it’s made with cheap materials. Always research first and read reviews.

"I take care of all the electronics I own. I've gone through maybe ten or fifteen pairs of earbuds so far. These beats aren't those earbuds, and they aren't like many headsets

This is a stupidly comfortable over ear headset with the sound and design to match its Apple product cost. It has lasted me seven months without any sign of trouble. It is sturdy, easily collapsible, and a fast charge for the one or two week charge you could get out of it, even with playing music everyday. Its bluetooth connection is crystal clear and easy to configure most of the time.

However, I am a six foot adult male with a big head. I should've gone with the Beats Studio 3 since its a much larger design for a little bit more money. I don't even remember how I broke the bands on the sided of the headset, though I'm keeping them together via tape.

These headphones are great if you can get them to connect to your iPhone. It takes about 15-30 minutes every time you want to get them to connect to your Bluetooth. I’ve tried everything. My headphones power button will be flashing and my iPhone will be searching and nothing happens. You just have to keep powering off the headphones and turn them back on to flashing or keep shutting your phone off and turning it back on.

"I like these headphones because they look nice and the sound is pretty good. Unfortunately, after about an hour of wearing them, they start to hurt my ears and the sides of my head. Also the cable works for audio but the mic didn't work. I thought ""no biggie"" and ordered another cord but it was the same issue. Unlikely to buy again.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"These are the worst overpriced headphones ever!! They will not sync with my devices, which is my main complaint. The device name is a bunch of lower case “j”. I think these were factory reconditioned. I rarely write reviews but, this is the third product I’ve purchased recently from AMAZON and had nothing but problems with!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
Love the product however it had to be replaced because it would not charge correctly. Luckily the year warranty covered it. This is the second pair I have had. The first pair has one headphone that no longer works and it wasn’t under warranty so I am stuck paying $150.00 to get it fixed. Therefore I bought a extended warranty for the the current pair. After paying over $300 for each pair I think they should last longer without having functional issues!,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I work with a lot of virtual conference calls. I had a Jabra provided through work, but couldn't pass up the prime day deal. The wireless microphone in the headset is fantastic. Very important to mute as it will pick up quite a bit.

Connects with ease to all my devices--iphone, bluetooth dongle on desktop pc, work lenovo laptop.

I seem to only have to charge once per week. I was torn between this set and a bose set. I don't regret my choice.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I wish i wouldve just bought these at the store brand new instead of on here. Headphones are not new!!! Ive had them barely over a month and they wont stay charged for the bluetooth and now the sound is going out. I've only worn these probably a handful of times.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I got these headphones to replace a Phillips brand that more than exceeded my expectations for the price I paid. I chose Beats brand because of their quality reputation and was really excited for their noise cancellation ability. While the unboxing was impressive and I enjoyed a full charge at arrival, these offer absolutely no noise cancellation as advertised. I bought two pair: one for myself and one for my kiddo. For the price I paid, I am extremely disappointed.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased these to finally go wireless with less ports on my work machine than before and I got to use these for about 6 months before they stopped charging completely, rendering them useless as wireless headphones.

They’re very pretty, and the folding aspect with the case is clever. The wire for using them as wired is nice but, if I wanted wired headphones I wouldn’t have paid an extra $100 for these.

Additionally, it’s worth noting that you should be aware of the size of your head. I wear glasses and found these very uncomfortable to wear after an hour or two because they pushed the arms of the glasses into the sides of my head. I could get around it by pushing the arms of my glasses over the ear cushion but this obviously messed with my astigmatism prescription.

The charging problem is not a one-off thing. Do a web search and see that many people have needed to fix this and it involves cutting open the headphone to rewrite it yourself.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these because they were on sale for $140 that day. That’s a decent price for them. I wouldn’t pay much more though. They are a little tight and pinch my ears after awhile—my head is not huge.

NOTE: the studio version has noise cancellation, the solo version does not. I bought these bc they were cheaper and the noise cancellation function gives me motion sickness.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"My fiancé gifted these to me for Christmas to replace my old Beats which were not wireless.

I love these so much! The color is beautiful and actually matches my hair. Sometimes my family tries talking to me not realizing I can’t hear.

The battery has up to 40 hours and it really does feel like it lasts forever. I can’t wait till I travel again because they are going to be amazing to use.

I highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones were terrible! When the box arrived, it was not completely sealed. It looked as if it had been previously opened. Also, the zipper to the carrying case that comes with it was broken.

After using it only 4 times, and within the first week of owning them, the material broke away from the plastic on the right side air phones as shown in the picture. Also, the headphones plastic cracked and split open and the backing to the auxiliary device mic fell off and wouldn’t click back on. I question the authenticity of this product. I feel like I purchased a knock off sent to me in an original box. Not happy. Returning them.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I will admit I am a long-time review lurker, but never actually post reviews here because I'm lazy. However, I felt as if I should give an honest review for these, as the holiday season is approaching.

I'm a HUGE music guy and have had a pair of Beats and every On-Ear model since they first rolled out. My Solo 2 wired in headphones got stolen out of my luggage and I recently got the iPhone 8, so I figured it was finally time to venture into the ""Wireless"" territory. I purchased the Solo 3 Wireless Gloss Black pair back at the end of September and everything came as expected and they looked awesome.

However, after 45 min at the gym and them being fully charged, they just turned off and would not power back on. I tried numerous Youtube videos of resetting them and charging them, but nothing. I chatted with an Apple associate and ended up bringing them in to the Genius Bar and even they were baffled at what was going on. I sent them in for repair and got them back a few days later and after one use the same issue occurred.

I then went to the Apple store again and we looked at everything, software on my phone, the headphones, etc, and they were still baffled. I sent them in again and they sent me a new pair. This new pair worked well, but would not power off (light always flashing) and also would not charge at all. Maybe it was just the Gloss Black style? I don't know.

Finally, after about a month of frustration, I sent them back to Amazon and searched forever on Amazon for a new pair of great wireless headphones (since I used gift cards to buy this), but could not find anything that had the fashion, fit and sound that I liked from my Beats.

As a loyal Beats fan, I insanely purchased a new pair of the regular Black Solo 3 Wirless beats and so far everything has been working amazingly, the sound is awesome, the battery life is insane and they fit perfectly for when I'm going running.

Moral of the story is these headphones are really great, but like they always say, ""third time was a charm"" and the whole process of getting there was a bit frustrating. Therefore, I caution on the side of buying any warranty on these, as all of my costs were taken care of and I didn't spend a penny extra.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm a headphone enthusiast and I love these headphones. I have Sennheiser 600HD's, amped, in ear monitors, in ear Bose headphones, and about 4 other cans.

I would say these are ""Fun"". They don't have a huge sound stage, but you can't expect a huge soundstage from on ear headphones. They sound great for Bluetooth headphones and they feel comfortable.

I originally bought these for use in the gym since I workout 6-7 days a week but honestly I sweat way too much and these only make it worse. If you're a sweater then don't get these on ear headphones, you'll be miserable, you'd probably be better off with the in ear power beats.

I give these 5 stars though because they just sound fantastic. And they have a 40 hour battery life. That's just wild to me. They are the best (or should I say the funnest?) Bluetooth headphones I've tried out so far and I tried out quite a few before buying these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Ok so I’m a really picky person when it comes to headphones, I have gone through jbl, skullcandy, Apple. You get the point, I’ve been through a ton of headphones, but these ones have satisfied me the most. Alright to my review, bass: bass is alright I’d say, enough to satisfy me, not to much not to less, I will be honest when this is at max volume, it will shake your head hard, but if you can’t handle that volume I do not recommend. Sound quality: this is what I love about them the most, their sound quality is litteraly crystal clear. absolutely recommended if you just want to hear every detail of the music and video that you are watching. Comfort: the insides are made of memory foam which is really soft when worn in warm temperatures, which is really good, the top part has padding. but when in a cold temperature it gets really hard and uncomfortable, so if your looking for headphones for a cold climate, I do not recommend these, I have a couple of friends who absolutely destroyed their headphones, like torn the leather from the headphones, but to prevent that, keep it in a case at all times you are not using it, don’t leave it on the floor, on a desk, basically anywhere without its case(provided). Noise cancellation: their is some to no noise cancellation on these headphones, so if your in a loud environment your going to hear it. Noise leakage: I have tested these in a quiet environment and no one will here you, ok if it is at like max they can here it but it’s like a whisper(friend told me). So if your looking to listen to this in like a library, these absolutely for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones were a splurge for me but turned out to be an expensive disappointment. Wireless solo3 right side stopped working after warranty expired. Took great care in keeping these headphones pristine and even bought an additional matching case. Fees to repair start at $130 with $7 shipping just to look at them. Waste of money and won’t be replacing them with Beats. I can buy better ones from other companies for less than the cost to repair or replace.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I reeeeeally wanted to like this. I have another brand already and heard my sister's Beat. I decided to get myself one. The sound quality does not justify the price. It is not far from the $37.00 wireless unit I have, but fine I was going to keep it anyways. Then the biggest obstacle was the functionality. On my headphones, I can easily maneuver back, forth and sound up and down. The Beats did not seem to have the feature. Nothing other than power on and off. I am rather computer savvy but could not make it work. Back to the MPOW unit. It functions better for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First off the connectivity of these is great. I was two floors above my phone and they performed like normal! I am an Apple user so that might be why it's so good. These are super comfortable and they fit my head super well! The battery life is no joke too, I charged them too 93 percent used them the entire day checked the battery and there was still 87 percent left! Once you put these on at about 5 or 6 volume everything else fades out. The controls on these are also super helpful. You can adjust the volume, activate Siri, pause songs (works with Spotify) and pick up and hang up calls, I mean what else could you want. These look super sleek on your head. I recommend the matte black because then they don't take fingerprints and scratches easily. One other thing is the mic. It might just be me but there is a slight echo so you can hear what you are saying. Everyone that I've called says that I sound great! In conclusion, these are a great pair of headphones and they are totally worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These stopped working on one side; the leather started coming off! We
Sent them to Apple to fix; they accused us of third party tampering which did NOT happen and they sent them back in worse condition then they were when we sent them and now they are completely unusable. The warranty needs to be honored! It has not even been a year!",1.0 out of 5 stars
My wife uses these every time she goes to the gym - this is the first pair of expensive headphones that she is actually willing to use. Great battery life and works flawlessly with her iPhone. She is very pleased with the sound quality and it does a great job playing that hideous hip hop crap she listens to. Other reviews are luke-warm on this model but I can't agree with them - it's great value for money.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"it s the first time purchase an on-ear headphones so can not compare with other products. I have it for around 2 months now, sound quality is a bit above average, It has plenty of bass. like other Beats products, quality looks good. The battery life amazed me, 1 hour charge and I use it for 4-5 days, 10hrs/day. The range is pretty far, more than 50 yards I still have good connection. The only thing bothers me is that it hurts my ears after around 1 hour of using. I tried to stretch it by put it over a few book, then use hair dryer to heat it up, leave it over night. It helps quite a lot.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these for my hubby as a graduation present since the ones he had were the wired ones. Gave it to him for graduation and he originally didn't even use them for about a month. So, about 2 months after purchasing them the cover on the ear portion began to come apart. The thread just started to unthread and now you can see the cushion part of the ear. He doesn't even use them anymore. I am very disappointed as these headphones are not cheap and this was his graduation present for getting his Masters!",1.0 out of 5 stars
I got these for a trip and I still love them. They work very well and match my phone. They have a case so I can keep the cord and charger all together. They are adjustable and easy to set up. Noise quality is really great. These are not noise canceling ones but they block out noise well. They turn off in MN cold if you do Bluetooth but work just fine with the cord. There are many color options too.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The biggest quality these headphones have is by far how convenient they are and how easily they connect to an iPhone. They also look very good and the sound quality on these headphones is all right as long as you aren't expecting too much. The controls are also subtle and easy to reach.
However, I cannot recommend this product. The biggest problem with them is how fragile they are. After only six months of casual use, substantial damage is visible. Particularly on the headband, which lacks cushioning and tears very quickly. The other problem is the price. You can find headphones that accomplish the same job for about half the price when looking at brands like Sennheiser or AudioTechnica.
This product seems to be aimed at younger people looking for good looking and convenient headphones. I recommend that you save your money and look elsewhere for headphones that look just as good, sound just as good and are far cheaper.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Birthday present for my 15 year old, he absolutely loves them. I tried them myself and the sound quality is amazing. Couple of quick points:
1. do not have the audio cable plugged in when trying to turn on or setup Bluetooth. The cable needs to be left out in order to do that.
2. if you do use the audio cable, the 90 degree elbow end goes into the audio device and the straight end goes into the headphones. otherwise you will only get sound out of one side.
We had a couple issues initially, but that is only because we didn't follow the above two points. After figuring those out, the headphones work great. Great sound and decent comfort. Easy to setup.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I am constantly wearing headphones and wanted to switch it up by getting a pair of over the ear wireless headphones. I've been looking into getting Beats for a while and was excited to try these out!

1. I love the look of them! Thought I'd look hideous in over the ear wireless headphones but they're super cute and look great.

2. I love the optional cord to plug into devices (not the charger). Provides a nice option if you want to use that!

3. They're kind of comfy. Not the most comfortable I've ever experienced but decent. Maybe it adds to a little discomfort with the fact that I have multiple ear piercings that perhaps are a little smushed with these style of headphones.

4. The sound quality is AWESOME! So great.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"First off let me say that when they are not broken, they are excellent headphones. Sound quality, battery life, range, all of that is great. The problem is they are not durable at all. The first pair I owned, I had to send back to the manufacturer after 6 months due to the battery that all of a sudden stopped charging. It was under warranty so they were replaced. 9 months later the right headphone stopped working but because it was past their 1 year limited warranty (from purchase date) there wasn't anything I could do. I ended up giving them a second chance and buying a second pair, which lasted a little over a year until one side of the headphones (they are expandable) came clean off the headset. For $250 dollars I expect them to last longer than a year. I would suggest going with a different companies product unless you are comfortable replacing these every 12-18 months. All in all its been 28 months since I bought my first pair and now I need to buy a third set of headphones, it will not be from Beats.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Broke after a year. Nothing weird, just wouldn’t turn on one day. Sent them into apple for 130$ for service. After hours of dealing with the service department, they told me I “made product modifications” and they won’t fix them for the 130. These have never left the office. Essentially was accused of being some sort of bedroom hacker with my headphones? Stunningly ridiculous. They told me they’d fix them for $369. Not sure if they’re aware how much they are new? The whole experience is insulting, I won’t be buying more beats products.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I loved this product and gifted it to my wife for her birthday. Its been 5 months and she has barely used these. In the starting she mentioned that it gives her pain in the ear lobes, but i said may be she is not used to headphones so it takes time adjusting. Now she started back and has got a permanent pain in the lobes that hurts her in her day to day activities specifically sleeping as the ears touch he pillow. She has stopped using it now and this product is a waste for me. I want to return it back and need my refund but amazon will not entertain it now. It has created medical issues for my wife and the product is still almost new here. I invested money here and i m really really disappointed with the quality.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I got this headset for 55% off normal cost and have not been disappointed with my purchase. Very impressed by this headset.

"Shockingly poor quality materials and subpar construction for a premium priced product from Beats (and Apple). The sound is solid - although they should get louder in my opinion - but after just a handful of months of ""light use"" they are literally falling apart.

The first Beats Solo3 received did not work. They would not go wireless nor would they fully work while plugged in. They had many issues. Amazon immediately sent a replacement as I packaged and sent the return item. The replacement head phones were as expected and worked great! My son has enjoyed hours of listening time in the few days he has had them. The battery is amazing and he loves the sound and feel of the headphones. A definite recommend.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I like this product very much. I have to say when I saw the packaging it made me realize how high the standards were. The unboxing experience was top notch and couldn’t ask for better. The first thing I notice when I put these headphones on was that the earmuffs were really soft and comfortable. Then I paired these up to my iPhone and I couldn’t even imagine the simplicity apple has created to pair these beats to a device. Next I played some music. It was very high quality and they were better than any of the headphones I’ve had before, the highs and lows were very balanced. And do not worry about these being counterfeit because I was worried when I purchased them but when I paired the beats there was proof of the W1 chip because of the simple pairing. The battery life on this is also remarkable I didn’t have to charge these for weeks till they were dead. Overall I really recommend picking these up, bye and I hope u like your beats. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these Beats headphones because they were on sale, and because I thought ""It's been a while since I had beats, maybe I should give them a second chance."" I should not have. I may be biased since I own high quality headphones, I have Bose QuietComfort 35ii and Sony WH-1000XM3s. I was expecting sound quality maybe just slightly below these with no active noise canceling since they were just on-ear and what I got was far below my expectations.

Sound Quality: 2/5
By no means are these the worse headphones I've ever listened to, but they are the worst headphones I have ever listened to at this price point. The trebles are just meh and that's the best part of these headphones. The mids sound like you're listening to someone else's party down the street or you're listening to someone else's music through a wall. It's atrociously bad and this is the worst part of the headphone. The bass is actually okay... until you have both bass and another range of sound playing at the same time. The bass quality is nice, and these really boost bass but you sacrifice washing out the rest of the song into a muddle mess and hearing nothing but slapping bass. This is fine, if you're a basshead and these headphones are GREAT when I'm listening to a bass-heavy rap song or EDM, but when I want to listen to anything else they're pretty trash.

Appearance: 3/5
These are beats and they look more like a fashion statement than any real headphones. Audiophiles will smirk as you pass by them because they know you paid way more than these are actually worth.

Comfort: 1/5
The clamping force is too hard for anyone to wear comfortably especially compared to what else is on the market for this price point. On top of that the materials used are super uncomfortable. The rubber headband pulls on your hair (and mine's short, I'm in the Marine Corps), the ear cups are stiff and made of some type of pleather probably, and after a half hour of wearing them (ONLY A HALF HOUR!!) I don't want to continue listening to these headphones since they push on my ears uncomfortably, grip my head and pull my hair (I'm not that into BDSM, thank you).

Ease of Access (iOS): 3/5
Ease of Access (everything else): 1/5

Connecting to an iPhone or iPad is a breeze, just turn the headphones on and bam you're connected for the most part. Sometimes it's a little finnicky. In comparison, the airpods have a much smaller form factor, better latency and better range.

Connecting to any other device is like trying to fight your mom; you'll probably win, but is it worth it? Definitely not. These will connect to your other devices, but in order to stop it from connecting to my iPad even when I had told my iPad to forget these headphones I had to take my iPad to another room and turn on these headphones outside with the device I wanted. Definitely cumbersome.

For full price of $299.99 these are just not worth it. Even for the discounted price of $160, they just aren't worth it.
Amazon has plenty of other well-priced headphones on the market...

For bassheads: Skullcandy Crusher Wireless ($120)
For flat EQ but good sound: Bose QuietComfort 35ii ($350)
For the best acoustic sound: Sony WH-1000XM3 ($350)
Best sound on a budget: Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (on sale for $130, but usually $150)

In summary, if you want convenient iOS headphones, just buy the airpods. If this is you're first time venturing into the expensive headphone market, I hope this review helped you move away from these headphones. I really don't know who these are for except people who were previously fans of the Beats line. If anything though, I think their sound quality has further degraded from when Beats was partnered with monster headphones. I hope this review helped!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are AWESOME! As a Mom, I am typically not a “name brand” kind of person. These were a gift from my husband and really a splurge, but I absolutely love them. Doing laundry, dishes, and other housework is much more enjoyable listening to music and these do not fall off my head like other headphones and earbuds I have owned in the past.

If you are a bass hunter or like dubstep this is for you otherwise look for better quality headphones low range is non existent or muffled and medium is there but super heavy on bass and the wireless works well but not long range enough the earpads are the same from other models so they will ware out better to buy replacements now or higher quality ones. You are buying the name not good headphones. Decent battery life.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"My nephews wanted these, and they love them. They sound okay to me, but I'd honestly look elsewhere if you want a high-quality, comfortable pair of headphones.

The bluetooth and battery life are the real pluses on these. The battery lasts forever, they charge pretty quickly, and the bluetooth has a really good range. The sound tends to be a bit bass-heavy and possibly muddy, and I don't know how comfortable they would be over a long session. I tried them out only for a few minutes and could only go off of my immediate impressions.

Depending on your genre preferences, these may be suitable. For me, I would look elsewhere.",4.0 out of 5 stars

These headphones sound really good like other beats headphones I have had. The problem with these headphones is how uncomfortable they are. If you are only using them for 30 minutes or so they are just fine. Anything more than that your ears will start hurting more and more. I don't know why they went with on ear headphones pads instead of over ear headphones. The studio headphones I have are over ear and they can be worn for hours without any discomfort.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I really enjoy the convenience of these wireless headphones. They're easy to use and fit comfortably over my ears. They're not too heavy, which I was concerned about because I plan to run in them, and the collapsible arms are helpful for storage. In terms of sound quality, I don't feel that they're especially better than other good quality headphones, but they're good. The sound quality certainly isn't compromised at all.

They sound terrific and young beautiful women are walking past me without noticing a darned thing. Battery life? I’ve had them for a month now and STILL haven’t used the charging cable.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is amazing and I love it, but only use it for less than 2 months and the sound is not playing in the right ear. I expected a higher quality especially since this is not a cheap headset. I expected more from beats, my husband have the pro and my son the solo. This solo3 is the only one not working. I'm very disappointed and sad since I really enjoyed it.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I order the headphones thinking they would do me justice on my deployment in Kuwait but I was wrong like way wrong. The first month they were perfect in every aspect of the word but out of nowhere one side went out and would barely work since. Two more months passed and then they just stopped working all together and since the warranty was with a 3rd party it just left me with broken headphones in the middle of my deployment. I will never buy anything like this from amazon again and amazon was my trusted source till now. So be careful what you buy and trust and believe these are trash.,1.0 out of 5 stars
90 days after purchasing the material began to tear away from the head piece. I took it to the Apple store and they replaced them only to have it happen within 90 days again. Warranty is now up and I refuse to order another pair or pay for them to be fixed. The quality does NOT justify the price and I’ll NEVER order another pair.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Power button stopped working after a little over a year, which after some extensive googling seems to be a very common problem with beats headphones. They were decent quality in terms of audio, not completely sound cancelling, but I liked them. If I’m honest I bought them mainly for their battery life and their appearance. Sad to have lost them, which I guess indicates something in their favor. But angry enough not to want to buy them again.",2.0 out of 5 stars
After only 6 months there is a short and they won’t work. This is our second pair of beats. The first pair quit working just over a year old.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"They sound really good. I haven't tested a bunch of brands, but I know Beats get really good reviews. The only reason I don't give them five stars is this: After about 8 months of use, these wireless headphones are starting to do what my wired Beats did -- the foam is starting to peel away on the ears. It's not the end of the world....I'll probably order some replacements when they come all the way off. But this issue keeps them from being a five-star product.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"It’s a bit base heavy, as it is designed to do, but I feel my music sounds so much better with it streaming from my iPhone.
I prefer it to the Grados my husband owns....
Headphones sit securely on my head even when running on the elliptical and working out. Very comfortable without feeling too snug. No headaches from wearing them for hours on end. Yeahy!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Was looking to upgrade from my original solo’s and I’m incredibly pleased with the Solo3’s. These headphones are so aesthetically pleasing! I got the Satin Silver color and I am so happy with how crisp they look. These are more comfortable than the original Solos and seem to be constructed in a more solid manner (I threw in a picture of my old white Solos for comparison, which might I add lasted me SEVEN years without trouble, hoping for the same longevity with the Solo3’s). The Solo3’s sound awesome and the pairing capabilities are lightining fast due to the w1 chip that allows for speedy pairing with Apple devices. I will update once I’ve had these headphones for longer to report on their durability and battery life. Extremely happy with my purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Item was listed as “NEW”. I received it and it wasn’t sealed, had greasy finger prints all over the headset, there was a beat up LG charger to replace the original one, the case was missing, and the instructions were missing as well. Make not want to ever order a used item even though I didn’t order one this time",1.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are really nice. The bass isn't too crazy but enough where it doesn't disort it. The sound overall is pretty decent. They connect easy and have impressive battery life. They last about 2 days without disconnecting them once. I would recommend these but make sure you read the specs before you buy if your looking for super loud bass headphones,4.0 out of 5 stars
"I love this headphones, they connect so easy to any device, ipad, TV, phone, and the sound is just amazing. I wanted this headphones because I've been doing binural meditation and I wanted to cancel any noise. I don't like having anything inside my ear and the tiny succion headphones create some king of pressure on my ears, instead of meditating I keep focusing on how my ears feel. I got my headphones on sale and although I wanted another color (whcih was not on sale) they are woth the price!! Best of all is that I can watch tv late without bodering anybody.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Much, much too expensive for what you get. My 11 yr old son insisted on these because of the brand name. The sound quality and build quality aren't nearly as good as what you get for this price from Bose, Sennheiser or Grado. The plastic circle behind the driver pops off every week or two because the plastic tabs holding it together don't fit tight enough. Bluetooth connection is pretty solid to both Apple and Android devices.",2.0 out of 5 stars
I love the headphones in general but have found that after 30 minutes of use and they make my ears hurt. They push against my piercings into my cartilage to be quite sore. I have attempted to get replacement ear cushions in hopes of getting some a little bigger but if you change ear cushions then it voids warranty. They also do not offer replacement ear cushions from beats. So in my case they have not been worth the money I spent on them. I attempted to allow my 11 year old to use them and he states it hurts his ears also. Might be just us might be a issue for others as well. I would go with the studio headphones if you getting them over the ear.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchase Beats Solo 3 brand new sealed but after when i received i noticed item it was open box and no sealed possible from manufacturer when i open i saw the quality of the item is so cheap look like fake or someone use before and return to amazon i go to apple store and purchase this from them and compered together it was lot different , amazon buyer be ware make sure receive the item brand new and sealed not open box",2.0 out of 5 stars
I have had these headphones for almost 2 weeks now and I love them! They are able to connect to all of my devices via bluetooth with no issues and they hold a charge for a long time. I use them for hours on end and haven't had a problem with the battery getting low or dying on me. The sound is also great. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a bit tight on my ears and it starts to hurt after about an hours use. I ordered the gloss black which I feared may look cheap or leave fingerprint marks but it actually looks very nice in person and doesn't get dirty easily.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are awesome for working out in a crowded gym– noise cancelling enough to block out all the other machines without having to turn up my music to dangerously high volumes, big enough to signal “don’t talk to me”, and adjustable so they don’t fall off my head when I’m doing abs or something (a big problem for me, I have a tiny and weird shaped head). Plus, the matte black is very pretty (in my opinion). Plus, the automatic connection from the W1 chip to my iPhone is a MAJOR bonus over the older models; otherwise, I can’t tell much of a difference from my old Solo2s. If you don’t have an iPhone, maybe save your money and go for an older model, but if you do, then the W1 is an amazing investment. Overall, I love em!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great sound, comfortable headphones and great price! All wireless! Great color and was waiting to get these when I could afford it, but these are $110 less than I have seen elsewhere so became my birthday present to myself! Convenient with a carry case. I would have made the zipper on the carry case open wider, but that is my only complaint. Even has a carabiner to snap it on something for safe traveling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought as a gift and my husband LOVES them! He likes to listen to house music so the bass is a huge deal. He could not stop talking about how incredible they are. While not deafeningly loud to the wearer, people around can hear the music. So I wouldn't recommend wearing them at a high volume in a library or someplace where you need to be quiet. The sound quality is superb though.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Very very VERY disappointed! After less than 6 months of using them (and I bought two pairs!) both are:
- Having problems since day one to connect through Bluetooth
- Going away and coming back sound quality
- Need to be charged for over 24hrs to work for 2hrs straight
- Disconnecting in the middle of work online meetings and webinars
- Currently, both pairs are NOT WORKING!!!

I am utterly disappointed, upset and I would never EVER recommend this product! I have been THE BIGGEST FAN of Dr. Beats and the products over the years but this has been super disappointing, especially buying them for Christmas gifts and never dropping them or doing anything that would harm the product or sound....
I want the seller to contact me immediately!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Liked them, sound was good, but they crapped out. No power. No lights. Charge was good while it lasted. Bought a new battery, but it didn’t fix them.

Super expensive for headphones that only made it 2 years. And, I really babied them. I have other Bluetooth cans and speakers (JBL’s and Mpow’s) that are much less expensive that are still working great. Surprisingly great sound on the cheaper ones also.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"So, everything came great and it was good quality. I just got a headache from wearing them because it was too tight on my head and the pressure changed in my ears. If pressure and band size isn't an issue for you then this should work great but if you are prone to headaches the pressure of these headphones won't be for you.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm a huge Disney nut & wanted these soooo bad but didn't want to pay $300. So when they finally went on sale during Black Friday deals, I was super excited!! At first they great & then after about an hour, they became really uncomfortable on my ears. It felt as though they were clamping my ears down to my head like a vice grip. I tried adjusting them, taking out my earrings or just moving them around in general. The only thing that helped was taking them off. I was so disappointed and had no choice but to return them. They were no good to me if I couldn't wear them for more than an hour at a time.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Battery power is phenomenal.
Two weeks without charging. Everyday use. The only down fall is the case in which the headphones come. It is so small and won’t protect headphones but that can be easily replaced by buying a bigger/hard case which there’s a lot to choose from here at amazon. Worth the price for the quality and duration of battery!!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is my second pair of Beats Headphones my first wireless version. They are perfect!! I fly all over the US almost every week. They connect to my ipad and phone effortlessly. The sound is rich and you can hear everything. Even thought they are not touted as ""noise cancelling headphones"" I find that they do a very good job at keeping the airplane noises to a minimum. I recommend these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Can’t say enough about the battery life. Bought them for my 12 year old who consistently is hooked up to wired headphones. He uses them for hours during the day and hasn’t had to charge them in 3 weeks. They still have 53% battery life left. Specifications say 70hr battery life but I really didn’t expect it. Only downfall is, the case provided with them is a soft case and not very protective so I would definitely consider spending an additional $10 on a hard case for them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Everything was great—worked just as described, looks good, excellent sound quality and very comfortable.....and then if got cold. Not crazy cold—it’s just 25F —just below freezing. They just shut off. Very sad as I planned to use them for winter hikes and cross country skiing....I would give it a 5 star rating if I lived where it was warmer all year.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Beats Solo3 Wireless do not disappoint at any aspect. Great sound, long battery life, easy to use, very comfortable, looks awesome. We are price sensitive buyers and we would like to get our money's worth. These headphones are a good value-for-money purchase. We gave this as a gift to our son and he loves it! It's really hard to get these out of his hands and I ""borrow"" them whenever I get a chance. I am looking at getting a pair for myself, too.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"My biggest complaint is that for an iOS device there’s no iOS App. You have to go into Widgets and add Battery in order to see the level. Another issue is it should either charge via lightning or USB c cable, not micro USB. I understand it was bought from someone, but they could have changed the way it charges to be in line with Apple products. Other than that, I like the sound very much. The price was very reasonable. The battery life is awesome,",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Very uncomfortable headphones, super tight and rigid. After just 2-3 hours use on plane, my ears hurts like hell and I have to take it off. By comparison bose headphones are so much more comfortable you don’t even feel like they were there, I regret deeply trying to save some money and not getting the Bose instead.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was a little worried about if I would be able to use these headphones for all my gym activities, but no longer! The color is amazing, bass and sound quality are perfect, and the Bluetooth connection (including how far you can walk away from your phone) work great for me. I ran in these and they didn't even budge. People were talking about the plastic on these, but the quality seemed great to me. Nice and light as well which I can appreciate in the gym. Love these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These lasted less than 3 months! Do not buy these. The quality of the product is obviously lacking. The number of people that report them breaking says a lot. For everyone that comes back and writes a negative review there are probably 10 that have problems. They work great initially, but simply do not last anywhere near long enough to merit the cost.",1.0 out of 5 stars

I love these headphones. I wear them to the gym regularly and use them for work conference calls. What blows my mind is I've only had to charge them maybe 4x in the several months that I've had them! Amazing product. The only negative is that they become a little uncomfortable after about 40 min esp if you're wearing earrings. But most of them do.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Super easy to sync with my iPhone and iPad. Good quality sound for a wireless set. The range and battery life are amazing. I can leave my iPhone in my locker at the gym and roam the whole building during my workout without losing signal. The only negative is that they make my ears a little warm when I wear them while exercising.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is amazing and the battery duration is very long lasting.

I loved mine while they lasted. Now only one side works when I connect it through bluetooth. The head pad that it has is going to come off really fast after you use them for a couple of months.

As people have pointed out, it's just dissapointing that you're paying a premium price and you're not quite what you expect.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for my Wife - she loved them so much I bought another pair (not pink!) for myself and I have to say that overall, when paired with iPhone, they are amazing. Extreme battery life. Fast charging and sync very nicely.

I did have to buy earphone covers to use them for running though as they have a moisture shutoff that triggers if you sweat a lot.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I travel a ton for work and rely on headphones that will reduce the white noise of the planes engines when attempting to watch movies/shows or listen to music. These headphones were great at achieving that and super great in instantly connecting with my apple products. Two stars were taken off for general build quality as the connection point for the right ear broke upon adjustment after just a few months. Would consider buying new model if build issues were resolved.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"bought for 13 year old son for his birthday. This was the best price I could find after looking around online and in local stores. I wasn't entirely sure my son would like the gold color, but he was thrilled by them and they're much more fun than the basic black. He's had them almost two months with lots of daily use. I like that they come with a case to take them along with us in the car or traveling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Beats delivers amazing quality in their solo 3 wireless headphones. Long lasting battery life and quick charges allows for tons of listening time. High quality sound and a beautiful Disney design makes these great for any music and Disney fan.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Headphones worked fine until sliding function broke. We used tape to hold it in place. Sent the product in and they refused to honor the warranty because applying tape was an ""unauthorized modification"". The tech couldn't care less and I've heard this is commonplace for Apple. They have your money...and guess what...they will gladly send you a new pair at ""market value"" which is currently $40 more than I paid for them. They broke within 2 months of ownership. Guess my son will have no headphones for his virtual school he is forced to attend. Thanks Apple for your compassion and commitment to reliability!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was very hesitant on buying Beats because normally they're heavy on the bass and muffled on the treble. Not with the Solo3. These were extremely well rounded in the Bass/ Treble. Don't get me wrong, these headphones have a lotta Bass at a high volume and the treble is adjusted acoustically to sound normal and not muffled. At a low volume, the treble jumps out at you with a crystal clear sound and the bass is adjusted to a low roar.

The weight is pretty well distributed. They sit pretty well on your head with no extreme tightness on the ears or the head. Yes, they sit on the ears instead of over the ears. I didn't realize this until I received them. I have used some like this in the past and didn't care for the feel or the sound of them. Once I tried on the Solo3, I could tell this wasn't the same story like in the past. The leather padding is great. A pillow - like feel on the ears makes these comfortable to wear for hours. Adjusting them is very easy also. Just pull , right above the headphone, up or down to fit your ear height. Also the headphones fold inward for easy storage.

Battery usage is definitely a plus on these Beats! Their claims that it last about 40 hours is right on target. The first time I used them, the battery lasted about 38 hours but after I charged them it went as long as 42 hours on a single charge so go figure. The 10 minute fast charge does last a good 3 hours so that is definitely a plus in my book.

As for looks, you can't go wrong. Typical Beats good looks, just packaged in a smaller size. I went with the flat or matte black. I don't care for the ""fingerprint"" look so I didn't go with the glossy black because reviewers say it is a fingerprint magnet.

Connection is a breeze with Bluetooth and even better if you have the iPhone 7. If you don't have the iPhone 7 or iOS 10+ then Bluetooth connectivity is as usual: turn on the Bluetooth on your device and look for Solo3. For IPhone 7 or iOS 10+ just turn on the Bluetooth and connect it once and your iPhone will remember the Solo3. Now, the next time you turn on your Beats headphones it will automatically connect to your iPhone.

The Beats Solo3 package came with its own storage bag, USB A-to-USB micro-B for charging and a male to male 3.5mm cord to use the headphones without the use of the Bluetooth.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Not sure what the previous buyers received but I just got these Solo3 headphones December 2019 and they are phenominal! I was nervous ordering them after reading the previous reviews, but I’m SO glad I ignored them in this case. The packaging is legitimate and everything that is supposed to come with them comes with them. The sound is A++ and the noise cancellation is perfect! Buy them! They are worth it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These aren’t advertised to be noise-canceling, so I’m not sure why I’m asked to rate that aspect. My only complaint is that the ear cups hurt my ears over time; I’m not sure why they’re smaller than the Beats and Beats 2 I also own. I love the sound and the wireless feature - holds a charge forever!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I use my beats every day to listen to music, podcasts, and audiobooks.

You do have to break them in though, they hurt really bad for the first few days after only an hour or two of wearing and I have a small head.

They also get stretched out and then become too loose, so I can't use them to work out or really do anything but sit or walk while wearing. I don't even trust wearing them while washing dishes because they'll slip forwards off my face.

I love my beats but I wish they were designed to fit better.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I got these things as a gift from my wife last Christmas. By June the black cover around the ear piece began to fall off. Called in and covered under warranty and replaced no problem. Fast forward 6 months doing same exact thing but warranty no longer applies after they are replaced once. Definitely won’t buy this brand ever again. Shortly after the foam wore off they completely quit working on the right side. Technically $200 for 6 months of use,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Solo3 will not disappoint! If you're looking for headphones with crippling bass these ain't it. However, the balance of sound from high, low and mid is amazing! The bass doesn't drown out the others, nor do the others cancel the bass effect. Just a well rounded pair of headphones. Love them!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I didn't read the reviews before purchasing these, but after hitting the purchase button I decided to go through some and see if there was a common issue. Well, I kept seeing that people were reporting getting fakes/refurbished products. So I became alarmed. They were same day delivery so when I got home and saw the box I was nervous I was sent fakes or refurbished headphones. Well after doing thorough research and watching several youtube videos, I discovered they were in fact real. I have had them for a week now and my only complaint is that they are a bit tight over my ears where my glasses are, but I suppose that's my bad for wearing glasses. Otherwise, they hold a charge forever, my last beats (purchased new at Best Buy) only lasted maybe 6-8 hours. These can go a few days which is nice. The sound quality is good, though they are not noise cancelling. I didn't need that since I mainly use these in my office at work, and I want to be able to hear if someone knocks at my door or walks in. Overall, pretty good!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought this for my son. Who said the sound is excellent. The ear muffs ""just"" covers the ears. but this is fine watching my son who plays D1 HS Basketball he'll take this off and leave around his neck. Because the ear muffs are small it doesn't get in the way under his chin. We tested the range some bit. No problem about 30ft. away. Sound and stream was still excellent. of course you'll always have the disance limitations set forth with Bluetooth tech specifications.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They were beautiful and great sound but hurt my ears. I ended up returning these and getting a really nice pair of off brand, over the ear headphones and they are much more comfortable than these and have just as equally good sound quality and noise cancellation. It was very disappointing these didn’t work out.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros: These headphones have great quality sound.
Cons: they smash my ears so after wearing them for any period of time my ears are sore. Overall they are not comfortable to wear. Additionally the case that they come in is ever so slightly bigger than the headphones so they have to be put in the case perfectly to fit.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are great quality headphones. I have owned a bunch of Beats headphones in the past but this is my first wireless pair. The bluetooth function works great and they can be converted to wired headphones just by plugging in the included wire. Sound clarity is amazing along with the bass. The only issue I have with these, as with all solo's, is that after having them on your head for an extended time they will hurt your ears/ make them sore. I would opt for he studios if you can.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Really happy with the product. The only downside is that they sent the wrong color ( it was supposed to be gold and they are rose gold) unfortunately I leave to see my family next week and could not return.

"For $200 I expected these to last longer than 3 weeks! Within a 3 week time span the sound went completely out in one ear and was off and on in the other ear, by week 5 there was no sound coming out of the headset at all!

The color is nice and they seem durable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love my beats. Sounds great, easy to connect to my S8 phone or iPod. Battery last long. Charges fast. I use it during my train ride to work or workouts.

"I'm not going to delve into the subjective territory of sound quality. I will say that the sound is rich and performs better than expected (especially given Beats' history of emphasizing bass). The battery life is stellar and Bluetooth connection has been impeccable with amazing range and only rare hiccups. My one complaint is that it is a snug fit on my ears: after 1-2 hours, they actually start to hurt my ears a little.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I waited so long to buy the headphones. I tested them at an Apple Store and was amazed by the sound fidelity and bass. Even my wife was impressed. But I wasn’t in a good financial status, so I skipped the purchase at the time. That was last year. I heard about Amazon Prime days and decided to wait. The Solo 3 was the 1st thing that popped out when searching for electronic devices. And for $139 this time I would not let it pass away. Simply the best headphones that I have bought. And let me tell you I have bought many.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I got these on Prime Day for a discounted price. I am not a headphone connoisseur but I was looking for something that was a little more suited for the office than my wireless in ear headphones I use at the gym. I have a loud intern that sits next to me who is the life of the office and needed something to block the noise out. It works. A little too well sometimes. I jump out of my skin at least 4 times per day when someone touches my shoulder or I see them out of the corner of my eye. Works for me.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've been a content user of corded, over-the-ear-headphones forever, always barely tolerating the cord getting hung up on my office chair several times a day... I've also been a bit of a snob about the Beats brand, shunning the brand hype and the expense. Not sure what put me over the edge, but I couldn't be happier that I made the leap/cut the cord. These headphones are fantastic. Battery life is excellent - I've had them for about 2 months and the battery still is half-charged. Great bluetooth range, superb sound. I use them daily at my desk job and at home (yard work, wood working projects, etc.). The controls on the headset are slick as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I was surprised by the solo 3s good sounding. Use them as workout headphones. Not worth 300 but got them on sale and they are good sounding plenty of volume not to bass heavy but got good sound and bass to them. And still using them to work out with no problems. Of course they always go back into the case.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent fit powerful sound I actually gave these to my daughter she wanted some wireless headphones for when she works out at the gym these have met her expectations and more they are very comfortable she said I have tried them on and they are very comfortable with that and the sound is great if you’re looking for the beat sound with the wireless capability then I would recommend these,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I really like these headphones overall, the sound quality is good and they're decently noise-isolating. HOWEVER, I've had them only for about a year, and the battery life and their condition has declined significantly. While previously I only had to charge them once a month (with use for HOURS daily) now they barely last a few days. In addition, one of the side hinges is broken, and that side of the headphones doesn't stay collapsed, and will kind of swing out at random. In general, I like these, but please be warned that they probably won't last much more than a year and a half with normal use. Personally, I think they're far too expensive to have declined this quickly.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these in November of 2018. It’s June of 2020 and they are already broken. One ear isn’t working at all and the other if I press on it it will work otherwise it goes in and out and sounds like static. For the price, they should last a lot longer than what they did. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these head phones precisely for the noise cancellation feature. My spouse has to have the volume so high while watching tv I was in Hope's of being able to cancel out the sound and listen to another device while being able to say in same room as the tv. Did not cancel noise.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Wanted to buy the Wifey a BOSE noise cancelling headphone instead, but she wanted these. Regret not doing it, but I’m a die hard BOSE fan. These are a nice set of headphones though. They produce great sound, not noise cancelling so if your looking for total submersion into the music, get some Noise cancelling headphones. All in all she’s happy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Five months and one side of the headphones goes out. The product started malfunctioning yesterday. Now, whenever I try to connect to a device wirelessly, one side is cut out. Not to mention the constant audio break up. The cord also stopped working after a month. Very disappointing. What a waste of $230!",1.0 out of 5 stars
I wear these headphones everyday to the gym and have been wearing them for a long time now. the sound quality is still amazing. the battery lasts extremely long and it charges very quick when low. one of the earphone covers just started to come undone but with the amount I have been wearing and sweating in them they still work amazing.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I absolutely love these headphones for my workouts. I previously had ear plugs and they were constantly coming out of my ear whenever I sweat so I would have to frequently stop my workouts to put back and readjust them in my ear which got super annoying when i'm trying to concentrate on burning some fat. I've been using these for about a week now and they are really great, i can focus on my workouts and the sound quality is totally bomb. i won't go into all the specs and technical mumbo jumbo cuz i don't know them, but if you're looking for something that stays put and has good sound quality and long battery life you can't go wrong with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I live in NYC, where the temperature at the the winter could be very low. For a couple of days temperature dropped down under 32 deegres Fahrenheit and I have difficulties to use my headphones outside my apartment. After 5 minutes outside, headphones switching off by themself. I can not turn them back on until, I am back to a warmer place for at least 5-10 minutes. I sent a message to Beats by Dre tech support, and I received an answer saying the optimum temperature for using this headphones is above 32 deegres Fahrenheit. So it means that I not gonna be able to use this product through the winter. On my opinion Beats shoul inform customers that they could expect difficulties using this equipment in the cold environment.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I have tried a few different head phones but wanted blue tooth and smaller ear cup size so it didn't look weird while I listed at work. For the price I really dont notice a great sound difference from something like my BOHM headphones at a third of the price. I have glasses and these things kill my ear as they are so tight with no way to loosen them. I would have expect more out of something so pricey.,3.0 out of 5 stars
They were working well the first 2 weeks and then everything went down hill. The sound would start failing in the right ear until it was completely gone and I could only hear from one ear. Then it wouldn’t connect to the Bluetooth on my phone. And after a while I had to call amazon for help on what to do because I had it for a little over a month.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Best wireless headphones hands-down! These are the easiest plug and play headphones ever. Right out of the box, they come with easy to start instructions, how to use the buttons and connect blue tooth. I was up and running in less than 2 minutes. They also fold really well into a case that is included. I'm really happy with the sounds, and they are very much noise-cancelling in my opinion even though I'm not sure it's advertised to be. Very comfortable, long battery life and well worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They look great. If looks are your thing, grab these. If you don’t really care about looks and sound quality is your thing then you can definitely find something better for this price. That’s the biggest issue with Beats.. Price. But even then, the sound isn’t bad, just not good enough for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Poorly made headphones. While the sound quality and noise cancelation are great, within six months of use the padding cover started coming off. For the amount of money spent on these, that shouldn’t have been an issue. I had knockoffs that lasted years.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First problem may not be 100% Beat's fault, however, they are an Apple product. They don't play nice with Bluetooth. Failure and intermittent connection, dropped connection, both on Apple computers. Maybe not Beat's fault, but they are useless for the intended purpose if unable to establish a reliable Bluetooth connection.
Second problem, they are uncomfortably tight on the ears.
Third, the on/off switch offers no tactile functionality. The headphones must be removed and looked at in order to power on (or off).
The sound quality and noise cancelling are fine, but so is every other brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"They worked amazing for the first couple months and then I had trouble with Bluetooth connection, the aux cord thing it comes with had a short in it so it sounds static-y with it in PLUS to top it off the right side stopped working on the headphones. I contacted amazon but they said I had to contact the beats support and the repair would cost almost as much as it would to replace the entire headphones. HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS DOWN THE DRAIN.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Love Beats overall, have used the wired ones for a few years. And now have the wireless. I highly recommend. These are perfect for people with smaller features. I’ve tried other over the ear headphones and they are huge and look silly. These are compact and cool. The charge lasts a long time. Read the instructions to figure out the headset controls like volume.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Fantastic headphones that quickly became a staple in my workout routine. I enjoy the moderate noise cancellation they provide. It’s not perfect, but I never needed it to be. It blocks just enough noise to allow for a nap on a plane or to focus on your workout in the gym. I really love these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I expected much better sound quality for the price. I have bought much less expensive ones that sound better. I only use these to workout. And when I lay down on the bench or on the floor, they are always falling off. Even when I have them completely tightened.",3.0 out of 5 stars
I love the Beats brand. They never fail when it comes to great sound. The quality of these headphones are great. They are very durable. The color is my favorite so that is great too. The battery lasts forever. I usually use these while i'm working out and doing chores around my house and I may have to charge them twice a month. This is my second pair of beats and they are only getting better.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my second set of Beats, the first Blue tooth. These are super comfortable, and easy to install on both my iPhone and iPad. However, since I live in colder climate, if the temps are in the upper to mid 30s, the headphones only last 15 mins at the most. Even if I wear a hoodie, they don't last much longer. This happens when the battery is fully charged, so there must be a shutoff when the headphones hit a certain temp. The battery doesn't drain, it just turns off. I would not buy these again.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"After 6 months, the ear cover has separated and cannot be easily fixed. Apple support was not much help and repair would be at cost plus $100 RT uber ride to a service provider 20 miles away.

"My first time spending $200 on headphones and was impressed with battery life and quality of music for a year. I connect them via Bluetooth as I have on very flight and the right earphone has no sound. I spend every minute u til takeoff trying to google remedies and disconnect/reconnect and reset. I didn’t get them wet, used the case religiously. If I had known they wouldn’t last 13 months I would not have spent that much. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was super excited to get these headphones. After about 20 minutes of wearing them, i took them off and my ears were throbbing! They are very painful to wear. I can't get past the pain so I'll be returning these, which is unfortunate because the sound is amazing and they fit me way better then the Bose soundlink headphones.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Stylish and sound great, but stopped working properly after less than a year. One of the ears goes in and out depending on your head position. A wire is probably a little loose on the inside. As pricey as these are I'd expect them to be more durable after being stored in the case and only being used lightly for a year.

Luckily they still had 6 days left on their one year warranty and Apple repaired them for free.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"My daughter absolutely loves her new Beats, she hasn’t heard a thing anyone has said to her since Christmas morning.
All kidding aside the headphones themselves are very nice. They have amazing sound quality, and they look and feel great. It took my daughter all of 3min to connect to her phone, set them up, and start listening to music.
Will buy another pair for myself, so that I can pretend not to hear my wife.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my first over the ear headphones. They pair easily with my iPhone and my Microsoft Surface Laptop for calls and music on both devices. The sound quality is good and people say they hear me clearly. I haven’t tried outdoor calls yet where it may pick up other environmental sounds.

The only negative is they get a bit uncomfortable on my ears when I wear them for longer periods. I think the ear cushions could be softer.

Next time I’ll consider spending more for more comfortable headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love these. The battery life on these last a reeeallly long time. Ear cups aren’t very large so they don’t comfortably cover the whole ear.

Bought these for my sons birthday and he absolutely loves them!! I don’t personally use them but my son loves them he uses them all the time and has not once complained about them.

"My cousin needed these for her birthday, so I bought it for her. It was pretty good, she liked these so much. I have also tried these myself and over all sound quality is very good. The bass is okay, but not much deep bass with these. However, these do have the noise cancellation feature which is very good and works very well. Overall, I would say my cousin likes these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Great sound and are compact so they are able to fit into smaller bags when they are folded. The battery lasts pretty long, I was quite surprised. I hardly ever have to charge them and I use them almost daily for the gym. The only complaint I have is they're not comfortable when wearing with glasses. They're a big snug on the ear so they do start to hurt a little when wearing your glasses.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Your used headphones purchased at full price may come with cat fur, earwax and dandruff like mine. That’s nasty.
Also, no cords included for these Bluetooth headphones. Just the used headphones in the case inside the beats box.

"Great headphones. A little tight on ears at first, once broken in amazing sound, excellent battery life, and very comfortable. I have 3 pairs of wireless headphone and these are by far my favorite. If your in the market at 200$ range, stop buy these and be happy.

Also, these block out the world around you. Not recommend for long walks on a busy road with no side walk, you will not here it coming!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm very pleased with my purchase! Easy to connect to my Samsung S8 plus. My Beats came fully charged, and I've been using them since I took them out of the box!

You only live once, and these headphones make life great! I definitely recommend these awesome headphones!",5.0 out of 5 stars
This is a good stuff. I've used it for a long time. Not any issues. But I don't know how to discuss it. I just want to clean up the review. Because when I look at the review which hasn't reviewed that I will feel uncomfortable. That's it.,5.0 out of 5 stars
I got the glossy black. Love this product. It's legit. Battery lasts a long time. Glossy black does not scratch easily. I even hit it HARD against a piece of equipment at the gym and the dent is still so tiny and not noticeable - so it is DURABLE.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"My husband loved these. They were great with his low hearing. However, they do not stand up to use while working. They have never been wet, always kept in the case. And just after the end of warranty they quit working. We think it’s because they couldn’t stand up to use while sweating. Can’t come up with any other reason for them to just quit like that after being so well taken care of. It was almost like they shorted. He was wearing them and everything was fine mowing then lawn and the boom, they were dead.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a gift. When I opened them, I was disappointed to see that the black material did not completely cover the ear phones on either side. The beige foam sticks out all around the ear phones on both sides. When I try to stretch the black material across the earphone to cover the foam—it won’t go--it’s WAY too small and will not stay in place.
If they don’t bother to refurbish them enough to make them look good on the outside, it’s doubtful that quality work was done inside. NO ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

"Best bluetooth headphone. Period. Quality is good but most important is you dont need to pair unpair anymore in order to connect to your phone, mac, ipad, watch. It connects to all at once and while listening music from mac if you get a call on iphone then you can just switch to iphone and vice versa. This is a great feature. When I go for jog then I just connect to my watch without unpairing. I have two and my daughter loves it as she can use between her laptop, phone and ipad.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I have taken very good care of them . I charged them last night so I could use them today and they would not pair. the pair light wont even come on. so I plugged them in to use and sound only comes out on the right and nothing on the right ! In my opinion . 300.00 is way to much to spend on something you only got to use 4 times. Ive had cheap ear phones that last way longer and when they bite the dust you can afford to replace them .

Material around the are ear headphones are separated after reading many reviews there seems to be ongoing problem I called Apple but they want to hold a credit card on file and have them mailed in.

"Great headphones for all purposes unless you plan on wearing them when the temperature drops near 32°F or below. These headphones have a wonderfully long battery life, effortless connections to I-devices, good sound and great usability. My problem, and it’s a big one, is that is impossible to use these headphones as a wireless device when the temperature drops close to or below freezing. At that point, the headphones turn off automatically anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes later depending on how cold it is. Sometimes, when the temperatures only at 32°, I can get up to 20 to 25 minutes before they turn off. I have called Apple and I have been told that this is typical for battery powered wireless headphones. I have not substantiated this statement with other brands.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"Super great headphones ever have. Was having a wired Philips and a SONY headphone, but always felt painful on both ears because wrapping too tightly to ears. This Beats Solo3 doesn't make such problem to me.

In terms of BT/wireless, it works wonderfully as I have many apple products and the Solo3 connects to all of them with easy set up and very good music quality. The long durability of battery juice and long distance of reception make me thumbs up!! I work in a lab often leave my phone on desk and walk around benches and even cross the hall way to another room. I never get problem to receive BT signals from my iphone7. It's also easy to check battery status using iphone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I had another pair of these that I ordered from Apple that were stolen and I was devastated because I love them so much that I ordered another pair. They are sound cancelling and comfortable sitting over the ear. I was never into bulky headphones like this before but after owning these I probably won't get anything else. I even use them when I shoot my gun because the noise cancelling is that good. I recommend them if you are considering buying them!,5.0 out of 5 stars
Great headset. Flawless pairing with all your apple devices. Legitimate 40 hours battery life and the range across our 3 level home no drops at all. The fatal flaw is i like to walk the dog in winter; if its cold; the unit shuts off purposely at around 32 degrees and no more music for the rest of the walk; i had 2 when i realized this i returned 1. They get more comfortable with continued use; not as comfy as the bose on ear bluetooth. Overall good purchase.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Wow. If you are a bass lover and primarily listen to rap or R&B, you are certainly in for a treat. These look great and although the clarity is not quite as good as other brands such as Bose or Sennheiser, they excel in the bass department. They are sleek and beautiful making these the best looking headphones money can buy and won’t stick out if you so chose to wear them with your favorite outfit. Overall, I strongly recommend these to just about anybody looking for a great overall headphone with great sound quality, bass, battery, aesthetics, and style all in one.",5.0 out of 5 stars

I bought these headphones for my son who is autistic and hopes that it would help cancel out some of the noise around us while he was watching videos or listening to music.

I constantly use them for the gym and school as well and they are perfect. For the price I would highly recommend,5.0 out of 5 stars
My beats seem pretty legit. The box came sealed with plastic wrap . I also registered them on the Beats website and they popped right up. I returned the Rose Gold pair because I work out too much and the white material seems like it would get dirty too fast. So far I’m satisfied.,4.0 out of 5 stars
I love them they are great. They have a great sound quality and are very comfortable. I was using them in a restaurant and I couldn't hear the music playing in the background. Even though they don't have electric noise canceling any background noise is hard to hear. I like how they came with a cord to use when the headphone dies. Great quality.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I was happy with the headphones, but after 6 months the right side stopped working when being used in bluetooth mode. It works completely fine if using the cable. I did some research online and apparently others have experienced a similar situation. Someone mentioned to try using the cable, but barely touch it to the port and that does bring both back to working, but as soon as you move it will stop working again. For the price of this product i expected better quality that would last.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"This are my new favorite headphones. I have absolutely no complaints. The fact that they come with a detachable cord in case you forget to charge them is very nice (even if most phones can't use the cord anymore).

Also, if you have any kind of problem with them, you get access to Apple's world class customer support. Just to be clear, there was no sarcasm in that last statement, they go above and beyond. I only wish I had purchased an iPhone...",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have had many problems with the pair of beats I ordered. First of all, the hinges started making some weird noise after moderate use of 2 weeks. When the ear cups loosened up, it started leaking so much noise. It is really irritating in college so I will get the studio 3 and give the solo 3 to my gf.",3.0 out of 5 stars
Overrated in my opinion. I've owned these for a 1 year and 3 months and they are now dead. I used these 3 times a week at the gym. For $300.00 I feel like headphones should last a couple years. The once a month charging was nice but I will not be buying any more Beats.,1.0 out of 5 stars
AWESOME! If you’re on the fence about buying these then JUST DO IT! It’s crazy how well they cancel out background noise. Me and my kids “experimented” with it when they first arrived. Unbelievable! These were for my son. My daughter has a pair too. I’m definitely getting me a pair next!!,5.0 out of 5 stars
I’ve tried the ones that go inside the ears and they end up falling out when I’m walking or running. These stay on and I love how everything around me seems like they’re dancing to my music. I love these!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Giving it a 5 star. Not to many complaints, except I have small ears and the covers are a bit uncomfortable at times. We purchased these and another high quality name brand pair of headphones and between the 2 I chose these! Great sound quality, great battery life & looks amazing!",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bought these as a Christmas gift for my daughter and she loves them. They must work really well because she never hears me or my wife calling her when she has them on lol. The versatility that they can be used wirelessly or with the cord comes in handy since she uses them so much. Her favorite pair of headphones by far.,5.0 out of 5 stars

"The beats came in what appeared to be good condition, but they do not work to talk on the phone. I don’t know if it’s an issue with the beats themselves, or the actual wire that came with the beats to use for phone calls, but when I plug the cord in, the audio only comes out of one ear and it’s bad quality. Other than this, they look good cosmetically but I was really looking forward to using them for calls as well as normal audio. They are also used. Not worth the money",1.0 out of 5 stars
"UPDATE: I made a phone call to Apple and they helped me to get a replacement pair of Beat Solo3. So far so good...

I bought these March 7,2018 for my daughter’s 14th birthday. She loved them until May 20th, 2018 when they would no longer charge. They are no good to us now that they won’t charge, $200 wasted.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I love my beats! They aren’t completely noise cancelling, but they have great sound. Super cute and comes with a storage pouch. I dye my hair and some of the color came off on the white parts, but I just say it makes them uniquely mine. But for real the white does get dirty quickly",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great headphones for the price!! I would definitely recommend for anyone that wants good quality Bluetooth headset for a minimal price, but two caveats, one if they are one your ears for too long, they can feel uncomfortable for a minute or so when you take them off, also the volume control on the headset is great but messes up at times making me accidentally pause or skip songs entirely. However, it is overall great and worth the money if you have it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound is not audiophile quality, heavy on bass, and overall good sound quality. But what really makes them great is the technology - the W1 chip, in combination with the iPhone 7 is a great combination. Battery life is insane (in the almost 2 months I have them, I have charged them only twice. Range is also insane while connectivity is a breeze. This is the perfect wireless combination for iPhone 7, hands down.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Not worth the price, sound is not of quality with other headphones of similar pricing, Bluetooth connectivity is spotty in a multiresidential environment and made with cheap materials. Mine broke at the plastic fold mechanism, leather always pulling apart from earpiece and I babied this headset. Band is really tight, ears hurt after less than an hour of use. This came with holographic security, so assume they're real. They are just not worth the price, turns me off to any of their other products, present or future.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"My daughter got these Beats for Christmas 2017, in June 2018 one side of the headphones quit working! Apparently that is common. Apple replaced them free of charge and all was good. Then in January 2019 one side of the extension area broke. Once again I contacted Apple support, however this time instead of a 1 year warranty, the replacements only had a 90 day warranty! So I could pay $129 plus S/H to get them repaired or I could spend another $200 and just buy new ones! Neither option appealed to me!!! VERY FRUSTRATED!!!!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
The sound is phenomenal!!! They have made my weightlifting better by being able to have more momentum by listening to music and I can do cardio for longer.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"With regular use, these quit working in one ear after only a couple of months. Called Apple for repair and they wanted to charge me $129 to fix or advised that I could donate the headphones. After researching this model more online, this is a known defect. Certainly not the quality I'd expect at this price point. Overall, my son loved them. We got them repaired and now he hardly used them.",2.0 out of 5 stars
This is the 3rd pair of beats I have purchased from here that has broken. The all have broke in a similar way. They all have gotten a short. This pair particularly I bought brand new and they worked for like 3 months until getting a short. I recommend not to buy them from here.,1.0 out of 5 stars

"I have this product for about two years now. After about one year the cushions were totally unusable and I had to replace them. I never dropped my headphone and always treated it nicely, however, after 1.5 years the wireless connection on the right headphone was totally broken and I had to use it only with wire. Finally today, when I was taking it off of my head the right arm broke for no reason and I had to glue it unless it doesn't stay on my head. I don't like the material of this product, it's very fragile. For a premier product it's not acceptable and I don't recommend it!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"For the price of these headphones its not worth it , you're really paying for the name. At most these are $80 headphones , the bass quality is Disappointing ! I've had other brands with way more bass , the sound clarity is nice tho. You here ever sound crisp , just not loud enough. I had some skull candy headphones years ago and they were ridiculous with the bass !",3.0 out of 5 stars

"Great pair of legit easy to use Beats headphones. I registered my beats with the official Beats website and they are 100% authentic. It came in an original Beats box with easy to understand instructions . Sound quality is studio sound, noise cancellation is top notch and the material for the earmuffs is very comfortable. Battery life is considerably long while it doesn’t take long at all for a full charge. Apple device Bluetooth pairing is fast and easy(will pair with non apple device). Definitely a must buy for anyone looking for legit Beats headphones, especially if you have an iPhone.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I love the sound quality and the battery life. I can go a week without charging them and I listen to them, on average, 3 hours per day. The material is nice. The ear cushions feel nice against my ears. I don't know that they warrant the high price tag, though. My biggest disappointment is the volume. I like to get lost in my music, and although the quality of sound is great, I wish I could get a few more decibels out of em'. I've listened to headphones half the price I paid for these that we louder.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Tried numerous sound settings on both my iPhone and my Mac. Still, it's solidly built but would recommend getting the extended warranty. My hunch is if used by an 'active' person (hiker, runner, etc.) the combination of natural shock absorption and sweat will increase the 'age' of the product.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"After several weeks of researching, comparing and reading reviews, we bought the Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones. I originally wanted the Bose QuietComfort 35’s or the Beats Studios. I tried them on, tested them out in-store and was having a hard time deciding. I saw a pair of th Solo3’s and tried them on, (not sure how I’d feel about the on-ear versus the over-the-eat style.) I was amazed that the Solo3 sounded just as great as the Bose (in my opinion). While not offering noise canceling, I could still hear most things around me with the Bose and Beats Studios. I felt the sound quality was just as good and I could hear just as much noise with the Solo3’s as the other two with noise-canceling. So we bought two, had them for 2 weeks now and traveled with them... we are extremely happy with them and would buy them again!",5.0 out of 5 stars

I had the beats solo 2 wireless and I cant begin to tell you what a step up the Solo 3's are. The battery life is seriously unbelievable. I use them ranging from 3-4 hours a day and sometimes up to 6 hours (I use them for work) and the battery lasts WEEKS its seriously incredible. When the battery gets low ill charge for 5 minutes and it's back up to 3 dots. It's INCREDIBLE, I dont even think my old Nokia's battery lasted this long! The finish of these headphones is about the same as the Solo 2's except for the gorgeous shiny rose gold accents as opposed to the fully matte finish of the Solo 2's. These headphones look amazing, sound even better, and the battery lasts a ridiculously long time. The price tag is hefty but as someone who uses these every day for work they were worth every penny.

I've noticed some people complaining about the same issue the Solo 2's had. It's uncomfortable to use them for an extended period of time because they are tight. Yes, at first they ARE pretty tight on your skull and are unbearable for over 2 hours. However, over time they DO stretch out and guys this happens to most On-Ear headphones. If you have very large ears I would recommend getting the Studios since they are OVER ear. If you want to speed out the stretch out process just stretch them out over something about the same size as your head and leave them overnight. Repeat this until they are comfy although dont stretch them too much or they will fall easily. I use these now for up to 6 hours at a time and they are very comfy. If you have earrings you might want to take them off before prolonged use, the back of the earrings will be poking into your skull.

Overall these headphones impressed me and this is coming from someone who already owned the great Solo 2's. You will not regret getting these.

"The sound quality was very good, but the headphones leak a lot of sound so if you're listening in a quiet place, everyone can hear your music. Also, these headphones are not headphones for being active, because they fall off a lot. The material and the quality of them though, is very good. Also very comfortable. Again though, if you plan on doing anything active, these are not the right ones. Update, the rubber cushion on the head strap came off of the headphones",5.0 out of 5 stars
"luv these headphones, no doubt, connect with press of a button on iPhone, but should come on automatic without no touch!
dr dre has to fix this problem! a bit pricey! well worth the sound! and also when its too hot, your ears be sweating! so i settled for smaller ear plugs!
comes with a wire , in case battery goes down, but it has a great battery life!",4.0 out of 5 stars
These sound great but within 3 Months the plastic on the adjuster band split. The item was defective but beats would not honor the warranty and wanted to charge $129 to fix. Expected better quality materials and for beats to stand behind their products.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are great!
The wireless function does peter out in very cold weather - so if you plan to be walking around in cold weather you may be disappointed. That's a definite thing. Happened to me once, but I don't make it a habit to be outside in cold weather. Aside from that, like I said - Great! Particularly the battery life!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Very disappointed, one side stopped working approximately 13 months after purchasing. Beats/apple customer service stated it would be better/cheaper to buy a new pair. Pretty expensive for 13 months of use.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I’d love to give this a full 5 star over all, however when I’m working out and go go lower my head, the headphones half the time slide around my head/ears and lately they’ve started falling off. The headband has adjustable settings which are nice, but I have mine set on the shortest. Maybe it’s bc I’ve had mine for 2 years and they’ve ‘stretched? I’m not sure. The stability is the only issue I have, everything is perfect",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these because they hold a charge for 40 hours of playback which is true and I'm happy to report it took almost a month of use before needing it's first charge. However, these have been charging for almost 2 days now and it still shows one light on the charging indicator. I've tried several different outlets, chargers and cords.....no luck. Furthermore I've tried to get product support twice now and no luck can't hey anyone to respond. If I get some help in happy to change this review but I'm getting impatient right now. At this point I will never but a beats product again nor will I buy high dollar items through Amazon again if I don't get help soon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"The pause/skip button glitches and sometimes doesn’t function until I reset the headphones. The cover for the earmuff padding has also come loose from its adhesive exposing the padded foam.

"I normally purchase from Best Buy, my last pair of solo 3 beats broke...after about 2 years or so. Decided to purchase a new pair, although amazon made me a bit skeptical at first... I decided to purchase a pair. Although the reviews on amazon for this product was
Pretty negative. My package looks REAL, although the case for the beats solo 3 DO NOT come with white inside, at least the last pair I purchased from Best Buy did NOT have the white lining. The packaged was sealed so I’m hoping these are real and not a rip off. For now we’ll see how well these new beats are. I would of given it a 5* but like I said the case for beats looked off.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Great sound but quality of the headphones is poor. A few months after purchase, I had to send them back because the fabric on the headphones came apart.

"Terrible they stopped working after 3 weeks. The left ear would not work at all on wireless. We did some troubleshooting and they reset but immediately stopped working again.

I'm a frequent business traveler and these headphones are exactly what I needed for business trips. They drown out noise on the plane and make it possible to take a nap with ease. Also great for daily commuting on public transportation. You can receive calls directly through the headphones so makes it especially easy to communicate while on the go!,5.0 out of 5 stars
Noise cancellation worked but after a month of wearing them (how convenient that the return window closed after a month) they started giving my husband BAD headaches. Did some research and realized it’s like sticking your head in a microwave it’s so bad for you! Not sure the quality of noise cancellation outweighs the health risks associated with it.,1.0 out of 5 stars

"This was a gift for my niece and she loves it! I will be ordering one for myself as well!! It was shipped and delivered right before Christmas. This style does not go out of style and the ear buds are super soft and handle is sleek. The black color matches with everything, that’s why she wanted it as well. I highly recommend 👍🏼",5.0 out of 5 stars
Bought this for my girlfriend for Christmas. She is in love with them. Couldn't beat the price at the time since they dropped because of Black Friday.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"First I was spectical that these were even on sale because we all know Beats are overpriced for what you get. Thank being said, since these are discounted they are definitely a great buy. I wouldn't spend $300 on these but I will $220. These are real and they came in the original packaging.

Now for the review. As others have noticed that Beats are very bass heavy, I like this even though I listen to a lot of metal but to some they don't like it. The sound populated is excellent. There aren't any cracks or interruptions at all. These are a very high quality SOUND headphone. My issue isn't with the sound or the Bluetooth connectivity.

These headphones, as other solos are, are built cheap. The sound coming out is great but the design is made out of plastic and i wouldn't recommend anyone going to the gym with these. Get the power beats if you're going to the gym. These feel like they will break and I have a feeling they will If I drop them hard enough. The ear cups re great leather quality and feel comfortable. I wish they went away with the plastic and made all the models like the beats pro were. The material in the design definitely needs work.

The Bluetooth connectivity is marvelous with this W1 chip. The range is insane. I went outside my house and down the street and was still connected without interuption. i don't understand everyone saying connecting is any different. Yes there's a pop up that says connect but all my other bluetooth headphones automatically connect after the initial set up anyway so I don't get this ""amaazing set up"" everyone is talking about.

One more thing I would like to point out are phone calls. The phone calls are so crystal clear. No one can tell I'm using headphones which is hard with Bluetooth nowadays. All around these are a great buy and I would buy them again (not for $300 of course). Sound quality is great, cal quality is great, if you can get over the plastic buy these!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Good sounding headphones, just didn't like the fact they look bulky on your head, meaning they stick out really far. They don't cover your whole ear like the Studio's do. They are also I bit tight if you don't have a small head. Other than that , they work well.

I’ve onky fully charged this set of headphones once since I bought them. I’ve taken them to the gym at least 30 minutes maybe 8-10 times and haven’t had to recharge them. They fit pretty comfortably and don’t really squeeze to tight. They sound great except not as loud as a previous set that I own. Th bass is not where near what it used to be. But over all still pretty good,5.0 out of 5 stars

"They go the extra mile selling fake beats. I would recommend just buying these at best buy. The packaging and design match the authentic beats almost perfectly, with minor discrepancies. But i believe they are fake because the W1 chip it is supposed to have didnt connect to my ipad air 2 like advertised, and the comfort of these headphones werent the same as the ones i wore in store at best buy. And the sound quality was pathetic, my cheap asus laptop has better sound than these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"So I know everyone is seeing all these one star reviews and how they’re fake and too cheap and stuff however, I checked the serial number, and everything was in check and these are indeed 100% real beats. I just got them today and I also saw others have trouble 4 months down the road. If anything happens In the next 4 months, I’ll probably take this review down or just add on but bottom line is that the beats I received were in fact real beats",5.0 out of 5 stars

The case is sleek & provides good protection.,5.0 out of 5 stars

When I went to Apple to get them fixed they were going to charge me $126!!! Save yourself from some trouble and just buy another brand.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"The sound is amazing and they're so comfortable! I think these are the best headphones I've ever had.

IMPORTANT NOTE: You should get a hard case to store them.

Some months after the purchase, the left headphone just stopped working when connected to bluetooth, but it worked perfectly fine when I used the 3,5mm jack. Luckily, I managed to get some new ones from Apple.

My guess is that storing them in the provided fabric bag harmed somehow the wiring, since the headphones barely fit in it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Great that I received someone else's used beats... I was a little skeptical when the box was not even wrapped. When I opened it, the headphones were scratched up and the cups had earwax in them. Absolutely unlike Amazon to send used beats when they are marked as new. When I paired to the device, it already pops up as Christian's beats solo 3.

The sound was great and all but the headphones just felt a little used. Shipping was fast though but I'm going to have to ask for a refund. I bought these for my girlfriend and my sister has the same ones; these didn't very much look the ones my sister got from best buy.,3.0 out of 5 stars
I have been using these headphones at the gym every day for a couple months now and the headphones have gotten loose to the point that I have to hold them in place if I am doing anything like looking down... a bit disappointed as I have taken extremely careful care of them and always put them back in case when not in use.,3.0 out of 5 stars

"These are the second pair of beats I have purchased, and they are great. I know they get a lot of complaints by music professionals as not being ""the"" top quality music output. However, to my amateur ears, I think that they are perfectly fine. The battery lasts forever....I usually have to charge them only every 2-3 weeks, and use them almost every day. Compared to pretty much any other rechargeable product, their battery life is amazing. I don't know how many long haul flights I have planned, and the morning of realized that I had forgotten to charge my ipad/computer...etc. These headphones are great, since they last so long. The music quality is more than sufficient for me, and the fact that they fold up means I can throw them in my purse pretty easily. I use them on my commute, for travel, and when I work out! Great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Item worked for a few months. Now they will not ppwer on and stay on. Upon trying to regoster for support unable to do so. I do not see help offered from Amazon site for assistance.

And I'm not talking about arctic temps, I'm merely outside in mid-20's degrees, and the battery shuts down. I looked at the beats website and other sites, and this is a well-known design flaw.

I love them. Easy to pair with my car and Android phone. Beautiful. Expensively made.

Bought this as a birthday gift for a friend 2 months ago and he STILL cannot stop thanking me for how great of a gift it is. He says the battery life is amazing and apparently can go 2 days without charging. And it’s also great for blocking out unwanted noises.... or people lol,5.0 out of 5 stars
Sound qaulity is very good and has a nice balance. The battery life is excellent and charges for the length advertised. The material qaulity is pretty good but not perfect.

(I was sponsored by a company to buy these headphones) I bought them for 12$ for a month (Tax). The headphones are really great sounding which is always expected by beats. Although the sound quality is great the Plastic that they are made of is poor. The headphones fall off your head easily so playing sports with these headphones are really not recommended. So don't play sports in these the moment they fell off my head scuffs all over and a piece came undone but was easily able to be fixed,3.0 out of 5 stars

I got the $99 pair of AKG with my Samsung S8+ and they sound okay but God forbid you step into another room. With the Beats Solo3 Wireless On-Ear Headphones, I can walk from one end of my home to the next and even check my mail. There have been times that I forgot they were connected to my S8+ and pull out of the drive-way and they're still connected. The battery life is great and charges quickly. VERY easy to use, no extra buttons to press on accident; just volume up/down, play and pause, and power -that is all you really need. My next pair will be of a different color.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Wanted a decent pair of wireless headphones after always catching a cord at work and breaking other pairs. I looked at a few pairs, these, some Bose headphones and some V-Moda. Honestly these probably had the lowest reviews of the 3. Not bad reviews, but lower than the other two in general so I was hesitant. I also had never read great things about older Beats, but they came down in price some to about 70 less than the other two so I decided to give it a shot.

I am pleasantly surprised. I am by no means an audiophile so that may help, but I think they sound very good. Pretty full sound, I don't think it's the best by any means, but it's a good sound and enjoyable to listen to. Range also seems really good on the bluetooth.

As far as comfort. They definitely could be tight to some. They kind of clamp down on the ears. I don't find this bad, but it's definitely something to consider in a purchase. I think overall they are very comfortable so far. A little hot under the ears after a bit maybe, but not bad.

I would recommend them if you want a decent pair of wireless headphones. Good sound, easy to pair, comfortable. Oh, and it also came with 30 bucks on the itunes store or 3 months of apple music. Since I will use that it's like I saved another 30 bucks on them which really makes them a great deal.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great depending on where you live.

"So disappointed with these very expensive headphones. They are uncomfortably small and hurt my ears after about 45 minutes. I get a static noise half the time I use them (wirelessly or plugged in).

"Pretty sweet. I love the price point, the battery last for days, sound quality and sound block are both excellent and I love that they have a mic for phone calls. One thing is the mic is very sensitive so it's not great for walking down a city street.

Only had them for 1 year and not been using them maybe more than 1 times a week. After one year the sound stopped working in the right ear piece. Can anyone give me advice on how to get help.

"I am extremely pleased with this purchase. First of all, it arrived on time and in great condition. I was a bit skeptical about purchasing due to some of the comments that I read, however, I decided to bite the bullet and make the purchase. There were concerns if the headphones were genuine (as in, true Beats)- yes, they are. These Beats by Dre wireless headphones are the best, I do not know why I waited so long to make the purchase! The sound is crisp and clear and my music sounds like it is live.

Setup was not difficult and I like that it automatically pairs with my phone so I can listen to my music. I have a Samsung S7 and it works perfectly- no problems at all.

I purchased these headphones for the gym. I lift weights, spin, and run in them. I have not experienced the issue some people complain about regarding sweating (and I tend to sweat when I am running). My headphones still stay on my head. For those that have that issue, I would recommend tying a scarf on your head. It will help hold the headphones in place.

Overall, I am a satisfied customer.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are trash to put it simply. The sound quality is not as good as I thought it would be.

I'm returning them for my money back. Not at all impressed.,2.0 out of 5 stars

I would suggest get an extended warranty if you are going to buy these are buy another product.,1.0 out of 5 stars

"I got these a few days ago and they were perfect, I had a long debate on whether I should get the Bose headphones or these Beats. The Beats won out. However after only a few days of ownership they are already malfunctioning. On two separate occasions while working out at the gym the volume levels would change on their own. Which doesn’t seem too bad I guess But considering these headphones are over $200 I was hoping for a good quality product. I am currently waiting on replacements and fingers crossed this doesn’t happen again otherwise I guess I will just go for the Bose.

Update: decided to just get a refund and go with another brand entirely after reading more negative reviews",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless headphones and bought the Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones yesterday. I did a side by side comparison and I gotta say, the Solo 3's sound better.... way better. I know Beats are geared more toward a the low end of the sound spectrum, but I played Hip Hop, Classical, Country, Rock and some Acapela. Every test had the Solo 3's as the clear winner. Even down to the sound isolation, and the Studios have ""noise cancellation"".

There's only one negative, it is the carrying case. Could they not make it a tad bigger?! I feel like just one more centimeter of room would have shaved at least 3 minutes off putting them in the bag. ;)

I have to be transparent, I got these for $210 on another large retailer's site (think the rain forest). Would I pay 300 plus tax? Probably, but the point is, you can't find them for less, just make sure the place you're buying them from is legit.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Heads-up - this is a lengthy review - but when you are considering a headphone at this price you deserve as much review as you can get to help you decide! I will rate by topic so you can also focus on what is most important to you. Let's start with context. These are my first Beats headphones - wired or wireless. They are not of course my first wireless or wired headphones. I have several wireless headphones including Jabra Move and Jaybird BlueBuds X. I also have several wired headphones with my favorites being KEF M500 (on ear) and Oppo PM-2 (over ear). My sound preference in a headphone is crisp and clear highs and mids with a presence and ""definition"" of bass - but not over done. Yea, I'm not a bass-head. So here we go...

WIRELESS (5 / 5):
Right off the bat, this is where these headphone excel, and why I considered and bought them in the first place. They are by far the easiest bluetooth headphones I have used to pair and manage with multiple devices. This of course assumes you are very deep in the Apple eco-system - which I am. I use these headphones with an iPhone, iPad and MacBook. Initial pairing was simple and automatic with my iPhone - place it next to it, turned it on, hit accept and done. Then in seconds the headphone showed up in all my Apple devices! And switching between what device is connected and active is just as easy. I could never get previous wireless headphones I owned to play nice with multiple devices even though they supposedly supported this feature. One wireless headphone always went back and forth between my iPhone and iPad even when I was in the middle of listening to music on my iPhone. Not so with the Solo3! And the range and battery life are incredible. I have owned my Solo3 for over a week and I am still on the initial charge. So hands down wireless performance is the best feature of these headphones.

COMFORT (4 / 5):
The Solo3 is an on-ear headphone and for me they are actually quite comfortable. The leather pads are comfortable and seal well - though they are not as soft as the pads on my KEFs. But maybe they will soften over time. The ""clamping"" of the Solo3 is firm and keeps the headphones very stable during moderate activity but not so tight that they bother my ears at all. The headband liner is comfortable for me too - I don't seem to have the rubbing problem some people have mentioned. And the plastic construction (see again under quality) actually has one plus in that it keeps the headphones light. I almost don't notice they are on my head until... The good seal and firm/thick pads cause my ears to heat up after about 30 mins so I do have to take them off for short ""cool-down"" breaks.

QUALITY (3 / 5):
This is a hard one to judge short term so my rating here is certainly preliminary. Bottom line - admittedly there is a lot of plastic here. Yes, it is a plus under comfort as it keeps the headphones light. But when you get in to this price range you defiantly see more metals and leathers and less plastic. And some wired headphones I have are so solid they have lasted me over a decade! I am not sure I will be able to say that about these headphones. And a 1 year warranty is not very confident - some headphones starting at this price point offer up to 3 years. It would certainly inspire confidence if Beats backed these a bit more and made me feel like the plastic construction was solid and truly there for comfort (weight). That said its too early to bash longevity yet.

SOUND (4 / 5):
Ok now the final and most subjective topic - the sound quality. Recall my sound preference - not a bass-head. When I first heard about these headphones with the new wireless chip - I was interested because of all the hassles I had before with bluetooth headphones. But because they were Beats I struggled to decide to purchase or not. I have not owned Beats because Beats headphones I listened to in the past were definitely too much bass for me - thudding and muffled. But I decided to give it a try - I could always return them. They are not going back! The sound is actually a pleasant surprise. Yes, they are more bass then what I own now - but they sound more balanced then what I remember. You can hear good mids and highs - though they are certainly more reserved. And the spatial separation is very good - these give a full and well spaced sound that makes you feel like you are indeed in the middle of the studio or concert. They excel with more Rock then Classical, so there still is a place for my wired headphones, but I also don't feel like I have to sacrifice sound quality to get wireless convenience.

OVERALL (4 / 5):
Overall, these are very good wireless headphones - they are now my primary go to wireless headphones for sound quality and convenience across all my Apple devices - though I am keeping my set of wireless Jaybirds for intense workouts only. They are even what I turn to now over my wired headphones for most music/podcasts unless I want to immerse myself in some Acoustic, Classical or Jazz where I still prefer my wired options. Value is good - plastic to price ratio is not ideal - but it is offset by the wireless simplicity and sound. If you want a no-compromise wireless experience, you should at least consider these headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars
At this point I have had the headphones 4 months and now they won't connect to Bluetooth. I also tried to connect them to a PC for an update but they will not connect via USB. I have tried to reset the headphones but that didn't work either. In contact with Apple Support now. This is my second pair of Beats and the other ones had to be sent in to be repaired because the right side stopped working.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"I got these headphones 4 months ago and for the first two months, the were great. A couple of months in, I started to have some connectivity issues and the earpads started separating from the base. Then the rubber headband started to come off.
Finally, a couple of days ago, the headphones died completely. I charged them to 100% and the still won't turn on. I bought wireless Sol Republic headphones a couple of years ago and they worked fine until I lost them and had to buy new headphones. I got these Beats thinking they'd be an upgrade.... They're cheaply made sold at a ridiculous price. NOT AT ALL WITH THE MONEY. THEY ONLY LASTED FOUR MONTHS!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Hey, So I'm writing my review on 7/18/19. I just received my beats solo 3's in the mail, and I ordered the matte black version. I read the previous comments that stated that people got fake beats in the mail and that sucks. I can't speak for those people, but the pair I received is real. I watched a couple of youtube videos to validate if mine were real and they in fact were.

Just hoping this review helps in case someone read the previous reviews of this product from this seller and was having doubts. I definitely had doubts and was nervous about getting a new pair, but am definitely relieved that mine were real and new. Hope this helps!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"So I have had these bad boys for about 2 weeks now. Let me tell you they work great! They came in the mail brand new sealed with all the cords and case. These have been used for gym workouts and casual listening. They do become slippery when working out hard, so I would not recommend running with these. I was skeptical at first but I have bad no issues so far. Make sure to buy a hard case as well to keep them safe!! Stand by for a later update!

UPDATE:
Going on 2 months now and they are still running strong. I used them mainly for workouts, running, and plane rides. No issues that I can detect. These are worth the money!

9 month review!!! These are still amazing. No issues yet. Keep in mind these are beats and very fragile.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Be careful. These are advertised as new and sold by Amazon directly; however, when they arrived, they don't work at all. Did not pair initially, then once paired, it went back into pairing mode every 2-3 minutes and kept losing bluetooth. Would not turn on if it was not plugged in and would not do a software update. Contacted Apple for support and it turns out the serial number on the headphones do not match the serial number on the box they came in. Apple says according to the serial number on the device, they were purchased last fall and are NOT new and have already been reported as defective. I'm very angry after spending this much on headphones, I expect them to be new and defect free. Returning for a refund and will shop elsewhere.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these particilar set of headphones for my grandson on May 27,2017. He was so excited! He receieved the headphones on May 29,2017. Three weeks ago the headphones broke . I told him it would be no problem as we bought the Square Trade insurance. Imagine my surprise to find out there was no insurance, In my grandson’s excitement he may not have done so. Nevertheless these expensive headphones should not break in four months time. I saw on order site that there was no restution for this product as the allotted time had expired.
The outcome of the product has really bothered me. Thus this email. I want to warm people against buying these particular set of headphones especially with the Holiday season around the corner. My grandson is almost 15 years old and is a responsible boy with expensive “toys”. $200+ is a lot of money to end up throwing away.

"So sad, I really wanted to like these. I used to love Beats.
The GOOD - And as far as looks go, the are fabulous - I got the rose gold & they are one of the only headphone that I actual feel fashionable wearing.
And they fit my ‘girly’ head; meaning that almost all great headphones seem to be made for guys. Why is that?! Don’t girls want the fabulous sounding headphones too (rhetorical question). Thus these fit comfortably AND they don’t look like I’m about to pilot a helicopter, mow the lawn or on the tarmac directing airplanes.
To repeat - this look and feel awesome!!
Now the BAD - the sound quality is lame. What happened Beats?? Dre?
I’m guessing that these are made to appeal to a wide variety of listening tastes.
Yes, they are probably better than most headphones made for general call/cell phone use.
Oh also GOOD - they pair flawlessly with my iPhone 7. Easy as pie to set up. And they auto connect perfectly. Also, they seem to have a better than most headphones length of Bluetooth connection.
But I must go back to my original point - the bass and over all rich quality of sold is totally lacking. It’s not horrible but it’s like listening to music “lite”, good but not great. Kinda like eating fat frozen yogurt, it isn’t bad, but is it it Haagen-Dazs... not even close",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are not made for anyone looking to seriously exercise in them. After 6 months the fake leather covering the ear pieces came off from sweat and that is even with beats protectors on. It’s now June 2018, so they two month out of the one year warranty and they simply snapped in half when I was taking them off at the gym. I keep them in a hard shell case, not rough on them. They simply feel apart from exposure to sweat during workouts. I’m very VERY disappointed",2.0 out of 5 stars

"When they worked, the sound quality was good, and it didn’t take long to charge. I bought them in August (gave them to my daughter in September for her birthday), and the mic cord came apart almost immediately - the mic cover came off). By January 1st, one side didn’t work. We’d gotten her a set of wired Beats a few years ago, and she treated them very well. The leather wore out around the ears, but there wasn’t a scratch, and she insisted they were still perfect. Because she was so good with them and used them so much, we surprised her with these wireless ones. The problems with the mic and one side were not caused by damage. The glossy finish is still in perfect condition, and she is meticulous with her things. I’m just so disappointed in the quality. The wired ones we bought a few years ago (3 sets) still work; so I guess we won’t be upgrading to wireless anytime soon.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"RETURNING!!!! I opened the box and the first thing I noticed was that the headphone case was cheap. I own a pair of the Solo 2 and the case is nice soft material. This feels like a cheap backpack from the dollar store. The biggest problem was the Bluetooth. I would connect to my phone and after only 5 seconds it would disconnect every time, even when I stayed close to my phone it still disconnected within seconds, after trying over 10 times, with 4/5 battery life. I am very disappointed in the company who sent me this junk. Never buying from these people again. Buy from Best Buy. I just saw that they are $10 cheaper, and more trust worthy, straight from the store. 1/10, 0/10 if I could. Buyers Beware!!!!!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Beats Solo3 is not the best audio out there, but the crazy thing is that I find myself wearing them more often than another $500 pair of headphones that I have just because they are so convenient and easy. They fold up small and are easy to carry in a backpack, holding up well to pretty tough treatment. The battery lasts forever and if it does die, you can get a whole study session of juice for like 5 minutes of charging. Connecting to my MacBook, iPhone, or iPad is so easy using the M1 chip and the syncing of settings through iCloud that it makes connecting other bluetooth devices seem super cumbersome: Just turn the Solo3 and choose it from your list of devices (no need to disconnect from one device before connecting to the next). And finally, they look good and are very comfortable.

So even though they aren't the best headphones I own, they end up being the ones I use the most because of how convenient, tough, long-lasting, and easy they are. Even though I said the sound isn't the best, the sound is great. The only time that I can discern that they are inferior is head-to-head, and even then, for some types of music these are preferred. They are certainly tuned to handle bass quite well, but they aren't overly bass-heavy as some other reviews indicate. So the sound is more than passable, quite good, and even superior for some music.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"A lot of people always seem to nitpick about about the items that they purchase off of Amazon. They always talk about how the sound quality could have been better, they always somehow find a reason that they think it's good enough to complain about the comfortability. Here's what I think about the beats that I bought:

They are one of the best headphones a person can ask for. I do not understand why people tend to complain about the comfortability when they have cushions for your ears. That's what's really important when it comes to wearing headphones that goes over your head. The sound quality is exactly what you would expect from a popular company. The sound quality is amazing along with the different colors that you can buy. When I first bought my headphones I had a question mark over my head because it wasn't turning on, but that was only because it needed to be charged. And that is the beauty of Beats Solo 3, if your headphones is dead, you can also still play music with the wires, just simply plug it in your phone and in your Beats.
I do not know if it is just me because due to the fact that I lost my other pair of Beats it's been such a long time since I touched it let alone wear it, they do seem to feel fragile, all the more reason to place a warranty on an item that happens to feel fragile. Now the question that everybody seems to be asking is ""is it true that it only takes about 5 minutes to charge the headphones completely, and is it true that the battery life last up to 40 hours."" Well the answer depends on how much you use your headphones. There is 5 LED lights that indicates the percentage of your battery of the headphones. If the LED light is on the third light, that just means that you are at least 50 to 75% of battery life left so in other words, it would take a roughly 5 to 10 minutes to charge it which isn't bad. But ultimately it is pretty fast when it comes to charging headphones especially when it turns out to be Wireless. The volume button Works along with the pause and play button, the button that turns on the wireless headphones work. It even makes that musical noise when you are officially connected to your device, and it does it again when you turn it off. I am able to extend the headphones. I am able to fold them which is a definitely a must for me because when I am finished with my headphones for the day I usually fold them.

In conclusion, if something happens to your headphone such as a shortage on the right or left side of the headphones, if you have a warranty all you have to do is just call Apple and they should be able to fix it either call Apple or whatever warranty you are affiliated with. In addition, if you have a computer or a laptop you should download this beat app where you able to update the headphones, I will not go into details but you could always look it up on your spare time. With that being said I'm giving this product and five star and whoever purchase it in the future, I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy what you bought. Not to mention that this was on sale because originally it was $300. Now in the beginning of my review I was talking about how people tend to nitpick and and complain about things that can be easily fixed. And I was very serious about that, they are the ones who bought the item off of Amazon if something happens to that item it doesn't take as much to file a complain and get a refund and get your money back after you give them back what has been broken. Since a lot of people gave it a one-star, I had to double think about me buying this. But when I purchased it it turns out to be great just as I was expecting, no issues to the point where I would want a refund.

Oh and by the way, the true difference between Beats Solo 3 wireless and Studio 3 is that studio 3 have the ability to cancel out noise, solo 3 although you are able to increase your volume the point where you are not able to hear a single thing from the outside world, there is still a chance where despite your volume being all the way up the environment that is around you could be louder than your music. So it is not fully a noise cancellation headphones. But these headphones are beneficial for me because I'm not always in an environment that is loud enough to where I have to blast it up to 100.

And this is where my review ends",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Audio quality is amazing and the design is, of course, slick. However this is the second time I've made a Beats purchase, and I've decided I won't be purchasing anymore of their products. Maybe it's because I use headphones so much, but with both products, they lasted less than half a year before something went wrong. In this case, the cushion was coming apart, and I was having trouble connecting with my laptop several times. Sometimes it would disconnect out of the blue and I would have to restart my laptop to get it to connect again. They weren't very comfortable on my ears either, so I think I'd prefer an over-the-ear headphones because this one squishes down on mine. It's a shame because the audio really is amazing! And I love the design and color, but for this price, it's not worth buying, at least not for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Got 2 pairs at once for me and my girlfriend who use them all the time with our iPhones. I have an iPhone 7 and she has an iPhone 6. I love the new pairing tech apple has in the iPhone 7's and up and these headphones are just great. You can use wires if you want to, which I think maybe makes the base a little better, though I am not sure how accurate that is. Either way, I LOVE THESE headphones! One thing I am surprised about is the battery life on these things. I charge them once a week and often fall asleep with them on Audible and wake up to them still playing all night and still only charge about once a week. The battery life is amazing, the range is amazing, the weight and design, packaging and comfort is just all top notch. I thought the battery life might be due to the W1 chip in my iphone 7 which uses the same tech as the Air Buds, but my girlfriend who uses regular bluetooth with her iPhone 6 reports the same ridiculous battery life. She also says that she charges hers once or twice a week. These are easily the most comfortable beats thus far for over the ear. Head fatigue is almost non existent.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Item arrived on time and well packaged. This was my first ever Beats product and I absolutely love it. These headphones are much better in my opinion than either the Bose noise cancelling headphones or the Jabra headphones I have used in the past. Excellent sound with rich bass and easy to use functions. As others have mentioned these headphones do have a deep bass sound which I think is great. The re-chargebale battery is wonderful and I still have not had to charge them after a month of a fair amount of use. They even fold up to put into the little storage bag that comes with them. These headphones work particularly well with my Apple devices as there is an Apple wireless chip in them. These are great mid-range headphones for a fair price. Quite frankly, these are the best headphones I have ever had. I highly recommend them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Just a heads up, these are knock offs. Pieces were falling apart the second I opened the box so that was my original reason I started the return process. I had no experience with beats so after I decided to return them because they were falling apart I went to Best Buy and tried on a pair, when then I realized they were not the same thing at all. I’m really surprised amazon is allowing this. I didn’t believe the other reviews, I thought they had some accidental fluke. Nope, they’re completely fake and very cheap bad plastic. Save your money and your time. $20 ear buds would be a wiser purchase, or save a little more and buy the real thing.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound was good, but the ear piece part was small for my taste. It put a lot of pressure on the outside of my ears...it wasn't super comfortable. If you have large ears, you may want to try them on first. But sound wise, they were great.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Let me start by saying that I got Beats after they lowered the price to $150 (I think they were $300 or something like that before September 2019). If I had to pay $300 I'd probably send them back and try some other brands known for the sound quality (Bose, Sony). Anyway, for $150 I'm pretty happy with the purchase.
First of all, they are very stylish. If you're looking for a product with a cool design, you won't be disappointed. I personally like the way they look and it feels good to have them on. Beats are easily adjustable, not too heavy, overall they fit pretty well.
It's super easy to connect them to all Apple devices. iPhone, iPad, MacBook, you name it. I connect them to a few different devices and never have any issues.
Unfortunately, the sound is not that great. It's not bad but I personally don't see any difference between beats and regular AirPods. I was expecting more for $300 headphones. Also, I don't recommend using beats when you work out and move a lot (running, jumping, cardio exercises). Other than that I have nothing to complain about. I think they are worth $150 but this review would be way different if the price was 2x higher.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are great! They are authentic and come in the original packaging. I use them mostly to study (I listen to static noise) and I wear them during my runs. They fit a little snug, but that may be because I have a large head. They feel most comfortable without my glasses and earrings.
When I listen to music the sound quality is amazing. I put them on when I am cooking and it really puts me in the groove. My chef skills have definitely been enhanced following the purchase of these headphones. If you can't cook, buy Beats for some good eats!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This purchase was a part of my rookie intro into headphones. I travel about 80% of the time with my job, airborne, and was having a hard time finding headphones that were both compact and functional. I bought these on a whim during Amazon prime day - since they were on sale - and only wore them a handful of times. They are nice and have good sound quality, but after only 30 minutes of use, start to REALLY hurt your ears... Especially since they sit right on top of your ears. To put it into perspective - I am a petite framed female with normal to small ears. I imagine if they are uncomfortable on me (5’2 / Small oval shaped head) they would certainly be uncomfortable on most people. I ended up purchasing Bose QuietComfort 35. The price point hurt, but holy %*!@ has it been worth it. I can wear my Bose headphones all day (literally) with zero discomfort. Plus, you can remotely manage them with their app. My advice - spend the extra money and buy something else. Even my cheap pair of Sony headphones were more comfortable than the Beats. Not hating - hoping this helps.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Like many others, I read the reviews of all products and filter out the reviews I feel are retaliatory or based on a shipping/seller problem verses a product issue. BUT, in this case my biggest and only issue with the Beats Solo3 is the product! It's made from cheap materials and not as impressive as the marketing campaign that launched the Beats brand. They are made of flimsy plastic, the ear cushions are made of foam and pleather that becomes oily, have fit issues, fiction and performance problems and the additional heat they generate around your ears is astonishing (maybe i should use these while snowboarding)! I've had mine for 5 months and shocked on how many issues I've had so far. Some background, I buy A LOT of items through Amazon and other retailers (some people might say I have a problem, I say I have my PhD) and this one of the worst purchases I've made! Issues I've experienced so far include; won't charge, won't turn on, won't turn off, Bluetooth not connecting to an iPhone or the car, pleather ear covering ripped on the left ear, plastic sleeve housing left speaker broke and now held together with rubber bands (about to upgrade them to electrical tape though 👍🏼) now the entire left ear housing has broken and will also get the electrical tape treatment. DO NOT waste your money or PLEASE go into a store so you can see them for yourselves and you'll be prepared for what your getting.

"I keep it simple sounds good battery life is good they are comfortable I don't like headphones that cover my entire ear cause they make my ears hot and I cant keep them on for long periods of times so there not many options out there for on ear headphones really most of them are like studio headphones and the ones that are not they are not stylish, things I don't like much are they slip off my head every time I bend they are slippery they over price in my opinion the adjustable size looks cheap the open up just grabbing it by accident for me they are delicate headphone you got to be careful with them if you want them to last. so for me they are ok cause my options are limited and I bought this with a amazon gift card so it was more like a gift didn't use my own money.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I used to have the Solo 2 wired beats and, after many cable replacements, I figured an upgrade to the wireless would be my solution. After nearly a year without beats, considering my stubborn self didn't want to pay for yet another replacement cable, getting back to these was like heaven. They sound absolutely amazing, providing a wide range and and depth in the music. I barely put them up past half the volume and am just stunned by the quality. Even though the Solo 2 were already fantastic, they truly outdid themselves on the Solo 3.

My only issue, which I'm unsure if it's an issue for everyone or just me, is that the clip for the bag and accessories was rather loose and did not close correctly. This caused me to lose all of my accessories and the bag. Luckily I had been wearing the beats at the time so I didn't lose those but I was incredibly upset that I could have and did lose some stuff. However, Amazon support was great and solved the problem quickly.

All in all, I really love these headphones so much. They have a great feel and sound and the ability to go cordless is such a fantastic feeling.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these headsets to replace a set of in ear headsets (Mpow) that just never quite were satisfactory for use at the gym and for general use. Never thought an over the ear product would work for me until I read the reviews on these Beats Solo 3 by Dr. Dre. So I had to try them.
This is my initial unsolicited review after about a week. I have the matte black color, which sometimes Amazon varies in price to drive choice. I got mine at a good time, though- Cyber sales- so it was a very competitive price.
What did I expect going in? Before I opened the box (quite a package, if you're into that sort of thing!) had good confidence that the bass sound quality would be outstanding from reputation of the Dr. Dre Beats brand. Rewarded in that regard and many other aspects as well.
Besides that though, there is a wired connection cable, and a charging cable packed inside and all the 'foo-foo' packaging you might expect from Apple, just to mention accessories you might expect.
I'm going to concentrate on what most people buy a headset for. So let's get on to the important stuff:
• Sound quality. It's unlike and greater than 90% of the headsets I have used. As an audio engineer (my past life) I have used plenty. The size of the cups is not an unusual one if you wear a lot of headsets- just over the ear as opposed a full surround, found I prefer this style these days.
• Great build quality/design of the ear cups. Fit well and very comfortable. I can easily wear for an hour at a time. After that, they begin to feel warm-ish (read I want to take them off for awhile). Most of my wear is inside the gym, haven't gone outside for a run with them, may be different impression.
• Outstanding battery life. I got them at what appeared to be 100%, apparently they weren't though. On my iPhone (11 Pro) when I looked, the power read 50%. SO I thought to run them down to the ground. I put them on days later and it read 25%. Used further for a work out for 1.5 hours and still good (20%). Gave up and recharged 'em. I will report back on a running time after full charge.
• Isolation. An over ear headphone has MUCH BETTER isolation from external sound by it's nature of the cups surrounding the ear. I my opinion these headsets DO NOT need further noise cancellation, with the possible exception of air travel. Further noise cancellation would likely affect sound quality. Have not tried the noise cancellation version which is MUCH more expensive. I have a pair of Sony noise cancelling over-the-ear type headsets for travel that do not sound as good as these but cancel plane noise VERY WELL. The thing is, they don't sound as good.
• Controls and pairing to several devices. Bluetooth is flawless and fast to pair to new devices (admittedly all Apple). Controls on the headset (pause-play,volume up/down) are VERY responsive. I did find that going from one device paired to another always requires that the second pairing be connected at the device again. The headset want to stay paired to the original device until a new device is paired. Once you have that concept it's easy to switch between sources.
• Microphone on a call sounds great to the caller and the caller sounds great in the headsets. I don't know where the mic is exactly but wherever, it works!
Listening test. I'm listening to the headsets as I write this review. I enjoy music and my favorite sounds are nothing short of magnificent played on these headsets. My positives about that are fabulous bass (expected). My only criticism is the ""mushy"" highs. So I had to engage an equalizer to improve the highs for me. On Music app you can fool with the settings. I pictured what works for me and I admit to some hearing loss, so what it means to you is only that there is no actual reproduction of ultra low bass (<30-40Hz, I'm guessing) or ultrahigh frequencies (>12KHz), which I think is to be expected on these type headphones. What is there is fairly well flat but could use boosting (again for me) and tweaking in the mid-range high frequencies. I feel that resulted in a major improvement. In my case with known music as the source and still with a bit of bass coloration, I found a sweet spot, to EQ settings as shown in the picture.
Review conclusion. An outstanding quality product! If there 4.75 stars I would give it that overall rating. Actual Rating. I'm taking off 1 star overall for less than perfect sound, likewise the bass quality because it was too overpowering out of the box and affected the frequency response. Apple knows something about audio and many folks will disagree with me. OK. My fix was minor on the computer source. However the fix for iDevices is not as easy, though I'm betting there is an app for that or soon will be because it's worth doing.
I may just get that app and use it, because these headsets are a pleasure to wear and use.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love these headphones, we will buy another Beats Solo3 next month after we save up. A bit spendy as compared to Sony 950 set that we returned last week, but absolutely night and day difference in sound quality. The Sony set had superb bass, but there was a trade off as treble and midrange suffered quite a bit (lacking). These Solo3 have a very balanced and deep bass, as well as detailed midrange and treble. Probably the treble was a tiny bit lacking, but full treble can be harsh I have found. I was thinking my Planetronics Backbeat did better with overall sound but after listening to them again to compare, I found the Solo3 has the mid and highs covered better as it takes the ""harshness"" out of a lot of it. Kind of cuts off the harshness of not only the treble and mids, but also the bass . No overpowering bass, but totally enough to make me happy . Listen to a lot of dubstep, and these are very pleasant sounding with that genre of music !!

Folding them up to put in the carry case didn't feel like I was going to break them, which I was worried about before I purchased. For the price they can not be beat, very happy (oh did I say that already) ? lol",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Update January 18 2019
After having to have my beats replaced FIVE times in less than a year, a person in a higher position talked to me. He made sure I got a new pair of headphones AND a new warranty. I did send them in for a replacement two days ago, because the ear coverings had started coming off again and would not stay in with the card trick. So I had that done while it was under warranty. I know that these beats won’t last forever, I am currently seeking a better alternative for when that happens.

Let me first say, I love my beats. The sound is much better than the past beats headphones. But the build quality is horrible. I knew they didn’t have the best build, but the fact that I’ve had to have my solo 3’s replaced twice in less than a year is absolutely ridiculous. I take very good care of my headphones, I’m not rough with them at all. These are way too expensive for the quality you’re getting. At least apple has been helpful.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited a year to post a review as I wanted to see if they would last. Yes the sound is great. Yes the noise reduction is wonderful, but if they only last a year, they are not worth the price! I've seen comment after comment from Beats owners that after a year or less couldn't hear sound from one side. To have them repaired is $129. There are you tube videos showing you how to tear apart the faltering side and pull wires, solder and put it back together, but if you don't have the skill set, you're stuck with Beats that only have sound in one ear. Get a less expensive pair of headphones. You'll be so much happier if they break and you are not out $229",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I rearrange my home office recently. This office is my primary workplace. In the rearrangement, my computer hutch and my desk are on opposite walls. As I moved back and forth my old standby Grado SR60 cans ended up pulling out of the headphone jack or worse pulling the computer on the floor. I was looking at the Beasts solo 3 wireless as they seemed very similar to the Grados. The price was right on Prime day.

These are on ear cans so I don't expect perfect noise cancellation. That said the experience is better than expected. The sound excellent and very transparent. I can go from bass heavy rock to string quartets without needing adjustments. Wearing duration is very good, with two to three hours with fatigue. Learned not to bend too far forward or the headphones will fall off. Bonus finding, these headphones are very good for phone calls. I was listening when paired to my iPhone when I had a phone consultation. I forgot I was wearing the beats and when I realized I did not make the switch to my usual phone headset I asked about my voice clarity. I was told the call was very clear.
Finally, the pairing to my MacBook Pro and iPhone was very easy and switching between devices is just a matter of going the menu on the device I want use and selecting the Beats.

For the environment when I use these headphones they are exactly what I want. There tendency to slip off when bending and noise leakage make them a poor choice when I am woodworking.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I kicked around the idea of buying these after I got my iPhone X, which lacks an earphone jack. At first I didn't want to spend another couple hundred dollars after I'd just spent $1200 on the phone, but I bought these on impulse while waiting for a delayed flight last weekend. I am really happy I did. I didn't read any of the reviews until after I'd made the purchase so I was concerned for....say, 30 seconds that I'd get a fake. But let me say with absolute certainty: THESE ARE REAL. I feel bad for people who ended up with knock-offs, but I got what I paid for.

This is actually my second pair of Beats, since I've had the ""sport"" version for several years. No, those ones did not wear out - they're still going strong for four years now, but I got them to wear while training for marathons and running on the road where I wanted to be very aware of traffic and my surroundings. Since then, I've migrated more to lifting and wanted headphones that would block out outside noise and let me get into my zone uninterrupted. As a gal lifting by herself, the chatter from the ""bros"" on the weight floor is still a little intimidating to me but these Beats do just the trick to help me tune that out, pay attention to only what I am doing, but still have enough awareness of what's going on around me so that I'm not the rude one who looks like she can't share space and the equipment.

The battery life is much longer than I expected and probably does approach 40 hrs like the product description says. They came fully charged and I first used them on a Monday and think I probably didn't actually turn them off but the battery still had juice when I picked them back up on Wednesday. They are a little heavier than I expected, but still very comfortable. I am not a musician and can't weigh in on the nuances of sound quality, but I can say that my music sounds phenomenal in these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for Christmas at the behest of my son. Overall sound quality is very good, as is the battery life. Where we ran into problems is when the right side quit working after 9 months. A quick internet search revealed we were not alone with this issue. Apple support was initially happy to send them off for warranty service but quickly denied coverage for a small separation of the left side housing. Seemed trivial but Apple was firm. For $200 I think you can do better. First and last pair of Beats for us.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"I bought these headphones exactly two years ago today. They now experience random disconnecting and won't repair to an already paired iDevice. At first, these were awesome! The pairing experience with an iDevice is so fluid and seamless. Pairing it to any of your other iCloud-connected devices is so easy. I went from my iPhone to my iPad to my Apple TV all in a day. The battery life is also amazing. I think I went 4 months without charging it at one point. Fast forward to today and I am really disappointed. My Solo 3s started to disconnect in the middle of songs and it wouldn't repair. I tried everything, even resetting the device and forgetting it on my iPhone. That worked at first but that solution would only last a day. I contacted Apple Support and they offered to replace it for $129 plus tax. Now that sounds like a good deal at first, but consider that I already spent $300 on these 2 years ago. I expect these headphones to last at least 5 years. And I took great care of these headphones, they were never exposed to water, and I never worked out with them (they aren't water resistant!). I think I am done with Beats, and instead, I will now take my $129 plus tax and use it towards the purchase of a Bose or Sony headphones. Hopefully, they have better build quality.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"After purchasing Beats Solo 3's I attempted to buy AppleCare+ at the Apple Store within the 60 day window. Apple informs me that the ""purchase date"" was more than 60 days (in fact is was 120 days prior to my purchase date). Further, trying to get a US representative is nearly impossible. Instead you are placed on hold for more than thirty minutes only to once again being connected to a off-shore representative.

"Not at all worth your $300. Seriously I would not consider purchasing these ever again, especially after the lack of support I received from Apple on them.

I purchased these originally in November of 2017. In June of 2018 I had an issue where audio stopped working completely with one of the ears (I can't remember if it was the right ear or the left ear). I brought them into the Apple Store they looked them over and determined they could be sent in. About 10 days later I received the headphones in the mail, but it was never clear if they were mine or a replacement pair that I got back (if they weren't mine, why did it take so long, why not just give me a new pair right there in the store?).

Fast forward to now, May 2019. I'm having the same exact issue. The audio in the right ear has stopped working. I've tried all the troubleshooting steps they ask you to perform (try on multiple devices, try with the cable connecting it to a device, reset the headphones, etc.). I brought them into the Apple Store, this time I'm told that my only option is to pay $129 for a replacement pair. Apple will sell you a new pair (with only a 90 day warranty) for $129 since you previously purchased this product.

Apparently the original product has a 1 year warranty on it. The replacement/repaired product has a 90 day warranty or whatever is left on your original warranty, whichever one is longer. So at this point I'm outside that window. I connected with Apple Support today, this time online, to go through the same process to see if I could find any other solutions. Same result, I can purchase the replacements for $129 which will only have a 90 day warranty on them.

So two pair of these headphones got me from November 2017 to May 2019, a total of 18 months. I'm not sure how Apple can justify that it's alright for $300 headphones to be completely worthless after a total of 18 months. Considering I had two pair, so they seem to really last roughly 9 months. I will never buy another Beats product again and I'm disappointed that I already own so many other Apple products :(.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Both my beats solo 2 and 3 stopped working between 12-18 moths. Same issue with the right earphone losing hearing without being dropped, mistreated, or abused. The first I assumed was a defect. Having it happen again, I’m convinced it’s designed with a flaw to force upgrades and stimulate purchases. Contacted apple support and after shipping both out at a cost of $130 each to repair, they refused and simply told me to purchase new ones. Poor product and even worse customer service from apple. Bought the Bose qc 3 in the hope that with spending $350, the products quality will mesh with the price better than Beats cheaply made product.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Without the warranty they want 3/4 of the cost of a new pair to fix. We’re VERY upset that this is how we found out. Apple told us that sometimes other people sell returned items...which makes us out of luck.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I was hesitant to spend so much money on a pair of headphones. I've always just used the headphones that came with my iPhone. Now that the iPhone 7 doesn't have a headphone jack in the phone, I've been looking for wireless ones so I wouldn't have to search for the little adapter. After listening to music with these headphones I realized what a difference quality headphones make. I got the glossy white and they are really pretty (which is a weird thing to say about headphones.) I'm really glad I made the investment :)",5.0 out of 5 stars

I can barely hear the music but I can hear everything else! Kinda bummed because I had heard some great things about them. They're beautiful and well made but my cheap wire earbuds that I was replacing blow them away... I'm glad I kept my cheap earbuds.

Now I'll go to maybe a Bluetooth earbud or wire system... Just something that has volume so I don't hear all the noise going on when I workout. Just want to hear the music and not what the people next to me are saying. So if you want volume and music when you're working out... You don't want these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Let me start with a couple things. 1) my phone that I use these headphones with is a galaxy note 8. 2) this is my first purchase of any set of headphones that cost more than 40 dollars so high end by my standards.
With that out of the way these are not all I was expecting for such a highly known brand. I have a pair of in ear wireless headphones with what seem to me about the same sound quality and for a tenth of the price. (They are 20 bucks). These are significantly better at noise cancelling which I can appreciate. However some things I have problems with besides the quality of sound is they are tolerable to wear for a period of time with glasses but after that period they can start causing a headache and just be extremely uncomfortable. With that said they do hold secure to my head and don't really move unless I'm moving my head a lot. I've been using them on and off for 3 days now and still haven't charged them (and they came with only a half charge at that) which is incredible to me. The other problem I have is it is extremely catered to Apple I believe. When in Bluetooth mode I had a difficult time connecting even with instructions, the volume up and down/ play pause button is a hit and miss whether it wants to work or not, and trying to go back a song does not work at all. It usually just skips 3 or 4 songs ahead. When it is connected via the wire the button on the wire is useless unless I need to pause and play. The volume buttons do not work and i cannot skip or go back songs. The final problem I had is the case. It is very limited in space which I can appreciate for on the go and packing in my backpack. However getting them into it's case can be much harder than is required.
With that being said, I do actually like these headphones and will keep them. They are a good pair of headphones. The negatives I've included have primarily been the biggest problems that I've run into.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"So i thought i had something wrong with my ears but nope it's the headphones. I've been wearing all kinds of headphones for long periods of time and I've never experienced headphones that would pinch your ears and give you an ear ache that you can't rest your head on the pillow because it's too painful. I've lost sleep, work concentration and money over these. Sound quality is better than other headphones I've used but none of those $40 headphones have ever made me loose sleep. Now I can't return them after using them for one month.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I realize that these are not inexpensive headphones. I wanted really decent headphones that had a really large bass response. Beats are known for their quality and so that's what I was looking for. Fast charging that will last for a long time, meaning that I only seem to need to charge it every few days, and I use it a lot. Also very beautiful. It has invisible controls on one side of the headset, meaning that if you press one of the sides things will happen, like volume control, and most importantly, if push twice it will skip to the next song depending on how you have your source music set. I have mine set to play randomly so I don't know what is playing next. That is controlled by your unit, not the headphones. These are Bluetooth headphones and you can hook them up to anything that Bluetooth's. It also has an incredible range on it. This is my second apartment I have had them at and it actually goes perfectly from floor to floor right through the cement without sound deterioration of any kind. No I don't know what the range is, and so it may depend on your own situation, but I simply do not think that there are better headphones out there for the price. Like I said, if you are looking for excellent bass response, and I like bass, because I listen to a lot of rock 'n roll and heavy metal, then these headphones are the right ones to get. They are also very sturdy and they fold up so if need be you can put them in your coat pocket. Highly recommended.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've had these since August 2017 and I loved them but I've noticed in the last few months, they don't seem as great.

I'll pause the song, push the little button on the headset, then push play on iTunes and they'll be fine again for a while. And then some nights I can't get them to work at all.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"So the first thing to know about Beats is that they are optimized/equalized before you buy them. You cannot equalize Beats. That's their whole selling point is that you dont need to. Now having said that the question must be asked ""is this a good thing?"" And the answer is, to some degree at least, yes. These headphones are extremely well made and durable and the sound quality is by far the best I've heard yet. The battery life is insane. They advertise a 40 hour battery life at a full charge and up to 3 hours of battery life with just 5 minutes of charging. As far as I can tell these numbers are lower than the actual battery life as on my first full charge i didnt need to charge them for almost a month all while listening to them 4+ hours a day for at least 5 days a week. The only issue with these headphones is these are really made for rap/hip hop. Now don't get me wrong, I have listened to metal, country, pop, classic rock etc on them and it still sounds extremely good, but hardcore audiophiles may not like the inability to equalize the headphones themselves. All in all these are by far the best headphones I've ever owned and definitely are worth the money.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones have decent sound quality for 1) bluetooth and 2) casual listening. They are on-the-ear style that come with a 3.5mm cable (for plug-in listening and full audio quality), a nifty carrying case. What I enjoy, however, is the pairing with Apple devices via their W2 chip. I recommend these for people with Apple devices (particularly if you have more than one). If you aren't an Apple user or have a mixed ecosystem, check out Sennheiser's HD series for better options.

As they are ""on-the-ear"" phones, you may experience fatigue after several hours. By that point, giving your ears a break (for any headphones) for a few minutes will be helpful.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"The Basics -
Build quality: 8/10
Sound quality: 7/10
Comfort: 7/10
Battery: 10/10
Usability: 8/10

I'm going to start with the build quality, which I think is excellent. Everything from the packaging to the ear pads is looks and feels well constructed. The design of the headphones is also very simple, so there is not a lot of variation in texture/materials, which gives the headphones their slick and stylish look. The only thing I wasn't very impressed with was the soft shell carrying case, which is only okay. It's good for keeping the headphones from getting tangled or caught on stuff in a bag or pack but offers very little actual protection.

Sound quality: 7/10
For on-ear headphones, the sound quality is pretty good. But at the price point, there are other headphones you could get that have better sound quality. That being said, these definitely perform well and I enjoy listening to them.

Comfort: 7/10
As with pretty much any on-ear headphone, these do start to get uncomfortable to wear after a while. However, I find that I can wear them a good 2-3 hours before they start to get tiring on my ears. I also find that I rarely use them for that long, as when I'm at work or somewhere I'm sitting, I probably won't be using these. So they're great for traveling, around the yard or house, at school, etc, but probably not a primary headphone.

Battery: 10/10
The battery on these is amazing. I believe the battery is listed for 40 hours of use, and I would say that's about accurate. I have yet to have the battery die,

Usability: 8/10
The power button is small but easy to locate, the headphones connect super fast to my phone (almost instantly), and the play/skip and volume controls are accessible and easy to navigate without any thought.

Overall I've been super happy with these and would recommend them to any looking for a stylish and good sounding pair of school/travel headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are very good headphones, but for the steep price, I was a little disappointed. Main points:

1. SOUND QUALITY: This is the most important part of the experience and this is the downfall of the Solo3. The base is too overwhelming, resulting in an overall muddy sound. I was actually quite surprised at how bass heavy these were the moment I first turned them on. Mid range and tenor sound tight and crisp without flaws, but its simply a bit over weighed by the intense bass. Of course this is a subjective determination...but count me in in the ""this is too much bass"" group.

2. WEAR: These are a bit heavy, more so than an accompanying pair of wired headphones, but the weight in itself is not intrusive. The headphones fit tightly, but after some time the ear pads do slightly pinch my lower earlobes. Its not a deal breaker, but again, I was expecting something engineered flawlessly for comfort for the price.

3. CONNECTIVITY / BATTERY LIFE: Excellent coverage on these for blue tooth. I can walk almost up to 10 meters away in a different room before these start fritzing out. A huge plus is the very long battery life. As I listen to music at work non-stop, I was sick of having to recharge headphones every 5-6 hours or so. I charge these once and they last several days and into the weekend as well sometimes.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I recently re purchase beats solo 3 black hoping for a great experience. Out of the box everything was great and working without any issue. Travel to San Francisco didn’t have any issue. On my return trip back to my home state I experience charging issue with the beats solo 3 headphones where the battery would not take a charge and stayed on red. I tried different cables and used an ac to USB charger still same results. I stop by apple and they would have to send it out for two weeks I was still under 30 day purchase period and had them returned. I waited and purchase another pair recently hoping for a great experience worked great no issues until today. My headphone were charging all night with no issue 5 white lights. Went to the gym notice it was at 3 white light s strange. 1 hours of working out the headphones stop working. Stop by apple they said try to reset and charge again if issue continue they would send it out for service two weeks. Came to the office and attempted to reset and charge my beats solo 3. The unit would not charge pass 1 white light for 2 hours. There seems to be issue with beats solo 3 not sure what it could be but I will wait before purchasing again.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Beats are great when it comes to sound quality, mobility and battery life. The design is beautiful, they fold compactly and come with an aux cable so they can be used plugged in to things such as console controllers, monitors, laptops etc. The connectivity with my iPhone is great and the bluetooth range is impressive ( I was able to leave my phone on one floor of the house and go in to the basement and did not lose connection.) There are two down sides to these headphones however, the somewhat fragile folding system and the clamping weight. Basically you fold the headphones over on to themselves to store them and it seems like you can easily break them this way if you aren't careful. The clamping weight is the pressure these headphones put on your ears while they're on. After anywhere between 20-40 minutes of use, I usually have to take them off and readjust them to ease ear soreness. The heavy clamping weight helps these headphones stay on your ears however while moving around/exercising but unfortunately hurts your ears a lot.

Pros:
- Great mobility
- Great connectivity
- Great sound quality
- Great battery life

Cons:
- Fragile design
- Clamping weight (hurts ears over time)
- Price (if looking for budget headphones or if you don't get them on sale like I did)

"I'm not an audiophile but husband is and currently own real great sounding headphones. I've got this ship n sold by amazon and it's 100% authentic and was able to register. We're not an apple household and I only bought this out of long time curiousity and it's battery life.
Coming from Sony and other high end brands, this beats is not really that special audio wise. The bass is good but it is too bass-y for my liking I find it annoying sometimes. It sounds great in upbeat songs because of heavy bass but too muddy and noisy in mellows. I am more into soul, jazz, classical, pop, country, acoustic, 70s 80s classics and the likes so this isn't my go to headphone. I cannot stand this headphone when it comes to slow songs. When I'm in a mood for some upbeat reggae then this is it.
It's overall nice quality, sound is good, just not $200 let alone 300 good. People saying this is the best in market probably never tried the really good ones out there (and it's okay). Glad I bought this at a deep sale price or I'd be crying by now. My $100 Sony & Bose sounds just as good and even better and clearer on most songs in my list. If we have same taste in music, look for something else, you'll find some with same sound quality but at a significantly lower price. And if you want to buy this, do yourself a favor, buy this on sale coz it's really not worth it's regular price. It's only worth $150 tops and that's already a stretch. If you've never owned expensive headphones and been saving $ to buy one then please look somewhere else: sony, bose, audioTec, bowers, beyerdynamic, sennheiser.
I'm keeping this not because of the sound but for my upcoming long international travel. I needed something that will survive me forever without charging since I'll be in the airport and plane for 2 days. The battery life is aweeesome- best out of all my bluetooth headphones!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are the real deal. Once I turned on the Bluetooth on my phone the Beats Solo software automatically appeared. It seamlessly connected to my Apple Watch as well. The Matte Black comes with grey lettering on top which also indicates that it is real. The sound is nice and crisp, especially with some old school Metallica. The headphones feel extremely comfortable, sturdy and light.

UPDATE: The USB BROKE IN ONE DAY. AMAZON REPRESENTATIVE INFORMED ME THAT ITEM IS REFURBISHED and NEW WHICH WAS ADVERTISED.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"It might seem harsh to ding the headphones for a software issue, but the reason you're paying a premium on these headphones is for the W1 chip, which makes it integrate better into the Apple ecosystem. If you're on android, there are better quality headphones for the price.

The W1 chip does let switching between apple devices work seamlessly, but the new iOS update (that I understand they have no intention of fixing) makes these completely unusable. I had to dismiss this popup 50 times a day whenever my headphones are near an iOS device. This happens on a device that's currently connected OR NOT. And when it's not, there's not even an option to connect. I have to dismiss this dialog in order to manually connect.

This is not a seamless experience. If I open my phone I want information quickly, I don't want to be reminded that my headphones exist. Do Not Disturb mode doesn't even and this misery.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Amazing headphones, I use them to do transcription and I am able to hear every single word without the strain or difficulties I had with previous headphones. The color is gorgeous and I love that it came with a case, cords and even a clip to put on the bag for when I'm traveling. The soft inner cushions for the ears are superb and very comfortable. I was worried that the white would be difficult to keep clean or would not look good but once I received them I saw that this would not be an issue. Controls on the headset are very easy to use, quick to connect to computer, laptop or cell phone and the sound quality is superb. I am very pleased with these amazing head phones and they truly are worth the splurge.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Overpriced. You can either buy for the beats name or spend half the amount of money and get something equal, if not better quality. These will break easily due to being made of cheap material. Then if you try to fix them yourself, you will need a whole set up (Soldering kit, replacement parts, and a steady hand). You’ve been warned.",1.0 out of 5 stars

This is first on my list.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I had the Beats Studio Wireless before I got these Beats Solo 3. The reason I got these was because of the Apple chip inside of them that makes it easy to connect them to your Apple products. Let me just say, connecting has never been easier. It just pops up and your connected. Done. Other than that, they look and sound great. They sound just as good as the Studios but I like how they are smaller. They do wear on your ears and the top of your head after a couple of hours of use. You'll need a little bit of a break. However, I enjoy these more than my Beats Studio Wireless head phones. The gold color looks just like the iPhone gold as well. A really sleek pair. Lastly, the battery life is unreal. They last FOREVER. I went a month until I had to charge them again with moderate use. They charge very quickly too. Battery life is not an issue with these. If you want a great, stylish, pair of headphones that sound great pick up a pair of these. If you have an iPhone these are a must with how flawlessly they work with the Apple devices. Highly recommend.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Recently purchased these and have owned them for about a month. Love them and the sound quality for the most part; however, the left half of the headphones have completely blown out without warning, so now only the right side is producing sound. Very disappointed in the quality of these for the price that was paid for them. Who wants to listen to music with only sound going into one ear?",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not a headphone expert and maybe I was expecting there to be a live concert in my ears but these haven't wowed me in the slightest. The ear cups are small and can get pretty uncomfortable how they sit on your ears, the sound is just ok. Not bad but like I said, I got just as good of a sound from a less expensive pair and to top it off, they pull my hair out every time I take them off. With everything considered, I wouldn't buy them again. I'm giving them to my kids and whatever happens to them, happens. I should have stayed with my less expensive brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I really wanted these and have owned Beats Solo2 that were great. I had to return this product 3 TIMES!!! So aggravating they do not work like they used to and have failed to the point of my having to return. Lost connections and wouldn't reconnect; I have a new Iphone and it didn't work as stated in pairing; you're supposed to just open them and they automatically put a box popup on your phone where you say connect. Worked once. Then when they failed, I totally reset and went to start over totally, and no popup whatsoever. I am beginning to think Apple has done something to mess these things up since they now own the company. Anyway, cannot recommend them.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"First review, more reviews to come the longer I wear This head set.
Wore them to the gym, they did not shift in any direction while wearing them. I wear glasses, I placed then just below my upper earlobe, no year pain after an hour in the gym.
Sound was great, kept it at 3/4 volume, was just the right level to get going, but low enough to hear if someone was trying to tell me something.
Quality feels good and durable.
I have an Android phone, easy to connect to. I also have a Kindle, also a breeze to connect.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones did not disappoint. There is not one bad thing I can say about them. Great quality. Great sound. I had no problem pairing them to my iPhone and MacBook. And yes, THEY ARE AUTHENTIC. I would suggest avoiding buying them from third party sellers, I believe that is why some people are receiving knockoffs. I would also suggest avoiding buying used Beats. Buy them new if you want to be sure you receive the authentic ones. For some reason the (white and gold) Beats were $30 cheaper when I bought them... they went up in price the day after I purchased them. If you happen to see them for a great deal, don't hesitate to buy them. If you're still worried about getting a knockoff, you can always price match at Best Buy.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones arrived today. After wearing them off and on throughout the day, I have enjoyed their quality in materials and the sound quality is great. I was worried that they'd be heavy on bass, but they're a good balance. I've listened to several genres of music and even some podcasts and the quality is consistent throughout all areas. My only complaint is that these headphones are not comfortable to wear for extended periods. After 30-45 minutes, they start to hurt becuase they put a decent amount of pressure on my ears. This is kind of a bummer because I bought these to use while doing online classes and school work.
*update*
I was working at my computer while listening to a podcast on these headphones. I had to use the restroom, I was able to walk all the way upstairs and listen to the podcast while doing business without any interruption! The distance on these things is ridiculous!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I'll start by saying I had a hard time finding genuine Beats online, if you search online you quickly learn what to look for. These were a bit less than retail, so I wondered if I'd be getting an authentic pair. It was indeed authentic (Mickey's 90th Anniversary Solo3 Beats).

The headphones are gorgeous, they make me smile. The sound is definitely fantastic. I had heard mixed comments on the Beats sound quality, but I spent this morning switching between the Beats Solo 3 and Bose QC35 and I honestly prefer the Beats sound quality. Of course, the QC 35 have perfect noise cancellation, but the Beats never claim to be noise-cancelling.

My only complain about the Solo 3 is that they are on-ear as opposed to over the ear. This means the cushions rest directly on top of your ears and I found that they became a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours of continuous use. I don't know if I'll get used to it, or the cushions will soften/adapt more to my ears. But for prolonged listening, right now, I would prefer an over-the-ear pair.

I'm overall happy with the purchase and I think most people will be too.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"As you can see I have a variety of different pairs and these are the best sounding, most comfortable pair I own. Synced easily with my iPhone, and work perfect with my Series 1 Apple Watch music controller. I wasn't worried about the sync being an issue. They are so comfy even with my 3/4 size gauges, with them being metal it doesn't push them into my neck like some headsets do. They don't slip around either. They cover my entire ear and make a nice ""seal"" I guess you could say. Literally if they are turned up even to half the max volume I can't hear anything around me. Definitely would recommend them to anyone. I got them when they were $179 had some gift cards and such so I got a great deal on them, Amazon definitely has the best prices on these keep and eye on it if you aren't looking to drop the $300.

UPDATE- My Beats broke within a couple months internally when I just unfolded them like normal and one side doenst produce sound.

These live up to the hype, especially for less than $150! I’d been using a cheaper (yet prettier) set of over the ear headphones but they would start to feel tight after a bit, didn’t have wireless/Bluetooth option, and the sound was tinny. Now i totally get the big deal about these! They’re light weight, simple to use, the sound is AMAZING, they blocked out ambient noise like a BOSS, and are so so comfortable. Feels like pillows on your ears. Highly recommend. My hubby has used them almost daily to work out in (read: sweat like crazy) and for travel and they last!!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Munson bought with his money this headphones. I have use them to test, the sound is pretty good but I don’t like the fit, they feel too tight on my head and the ear caps feel to little.

If that is the case, I would rather buy another brand that will hold up. It is great the sound quality and battery life is fantastic, but if they are falling apart like this, how am I supposed to use them. Seems like a bad design.

"Pros
Amazing 40-hour battery life
Good, clear sound on iphone7 from all audio sources (music & other audio playback apps such as YouTube)
Decent call quality for user and caller (unsure of performance in noisy backgrounds or windy conditions)
Good volume range for audio playback and phone calls
Decent noise canceling ability without integration of electronic noise canceling technology (I think ear cups are manually designed for optimum noise canceling)
Cord with high-quality mic provided with headset
USB charging fcable included (able to use iPhone wall charger or other compatible USB wall charger to charge headset as well as charging from connection to PC)
Only 2 hours charging time for full battery life
Comfortable ear cup padding
Headset controls not flimsy and easy to operate
Unbroken long-range Bluetooth connectivity using iphone7
Steller support for software updates, Bluetooth connectivity, and support questions (Beats products are owned and supported by Apple company)
Easy setup and installation with iphone7 (unsure of performance with Mac or Windows PC)

Cons
Some notable trouble using headset to answer mobile calls as well as soft phone calls (skype, what's app, etc.)
Very tight fit (tight squeeze on head causing frequent headaches, though diminished a slight bit after frequent use)
No voice feedback when operating controls (battery life can only be determined by viewing indicator LEDS; troublesome for blind user)
Strangely, no headset battery indicator on iphone7 status bar (many other bluetooth headsets show battery status next to Bluetooth indicator on iPhone status bar)

Well, as you can see, I've experienced a mixed bag of positive and negatives in using this headset. Here are some additional observations based on my experience.

* Though I'm not an experienced audiofile, the bass seems full without distorting other sounds. I experienced enjoyable audio quality when watching TV apps, youtube videos, and listening to music.
* My main purpose for trying this headset was for phone call quality by comparing them with the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series. I did experience fairly clear feedback from callers when using the headset, but callers sometimes reported a bit of distortion from my end but it was only slight. Additionally, I had frequent occurrences where, after receiving a call, I could not answer with the headset when trying to use them to answer the call. Instead, the call was routed to the iPhone itself and I had to manually route the call to the headset.

An Interesting Experience to Note

However, the strangest anomaly occurred when using this headset. From reading reviews and talking with Apple support, I was told, definitively, that this headset does not have a built-in mic when being used wirelessly (accompanying cord does have built-in mic). However, I successfully used the headset using Bluetooth connection (not with cord) and callers could hear me with no trouble. So, I reasoned that if this Beats headset doesn't have a built-in mic, then my iphone7's mic is being used to communicate with callers. However, after moving over 100ft. from my iPhone, the callers could hear me as clearly as when I was less than 5ft. away from the iPhone. So, I really don't know how my voice is being transmitted to callers when I'm communicating wirelessly with this headset. hmmm!

* In addition to trouble in answering calls with this headset, my main beef with this Beats product is the really tight squeeze on my head. Unfortunately, this tightness was quite uncomfortable to the point where I dealt with several headaches. Though I've only had these for 3 weeks, the discomfort has only diminished slightly.

Frankly, because I find the Plantronics Voyager 8200 series to have superior call quality on both ends and to be much more comfortable than these, I will most likely return this headset though it consists of many good features such as seamless connectivity with the iPhone and amazingly high battery life.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"We got these on Black Friday which made them an excellent value. Overall, these headphones are very comfortable and above average from a sound quality standpoint. There are many cheaper options out there, many of which I have tried, but I think that these are really a step up.

My first pair lasted less than a year before they started giving problems. Battery life started decreasing. Then the led on/off light wouldn't turn off so it began draining the battery. So sent it in to be repaired thru warranty company. Well they sent it back in worse condition. Headphones went dead after 3 days and would not recharge. I also found damage on the right earpiece that looks like it was preyed open with a flat head screwdriver. So I informed warranty company again and then called amazon. The rep from amazon was really cool. Said not to worry we are sending you a brand new pair instead. Love how amazon takes care of the problem better than aftermarket warranty company.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased the Beats for my daughter and she loves them. This is the second set of Solo3's I've purchased for her. The left speaker failed on each pair. I've done research on the internet and learned that Beats has a problem with the left speaker failing due to a small wire being pinched during production. Unknown if this is the problem with the Beats I've purchased. The second pair I sent back for repair and am still waiting for them to be returned. Apple/Beats needs to address this problem immediately. Amazon has been great with their fast response to assisting us with sending them back for repair, however we were told ten days. It's been longer than that. Thanks",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are...petite, I guess would describe it. They're on-ear, and even when extended fully the headband clamps them on to your head with a tenacity worthy of something from the first Alien movie. My ears can't take more than about 20 minutes before the aching and lack of blood circulation force me to take them off. Haven't encountered this with other on-ear headphones before - the first step in using headphones is actually leaving them on your head, and when that's not really possible, all other considerations pale in significance.

That said, the sound quality is OK, but not great. These sound better than previous Beats headphones, so Beats is definitely improving, but for the price, there are better sounding headphones. These headphones don't overemphasize bass as much as older Beats headphones did, but it's still a bass-heavy headphone. If you want to hear treble and mid-range, there are cheaper headphones that will deliver them more effectively.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a replacement my cheap $25 bluetooth headphones. What a world of difference. Every genre of music sounds fantastic. They are a bit heavy but you get used to the weight. The controls are on the side of the headphones and are easy to use. They pair very easily with Apple products and even with Android products. I found there was a bit of delay with the signal for Kindle HD 10 but I had that same problem with my old headphones. However, the trouble didn't last long. I wore the headphones on a long 2 mile walk and although my ears got warm they did not sweat profusely. I wouldn't use them for a hard workout though. I wish the ear cups were a bit bigger because while I was walking there was a bit of pressure on my ears. They are great for sitting at home and even some light housework. The range is decent but the signal will start to break up around 500 feet away. I would recommend an arm band for your phone or mp3 device if you would like to walk around the house with them and still have good signal. They reduce a lot of exterior noise so they could be good on an airplane or library.",4.0 out of 5 stars
Purchased these head phones under 2 years ago. They are in great condition. Very little use of the past 2 years. They stopped taking a charge months ago. Finally got around to contacting Apple support about the issue. The one year limited warranty did help Apple would not replace the defective Beats Solo headset. Very disappointed with their service and not willing to stand behind their products. Recently my son had a issue with wireless Bose headset. The covering came off due to wear. They too were about 2 years old and out of warranty. Bose support send him a shipping label and replaced the headset free of charge. I'm a Bose customer for life.

"I’m primarily comparing the beats I own to DNA monster headphones I purchased at sharper image. DNA put the beats to shame in sound quality, the quality of materials is equivalent, whereas the beats win in terms of battery.

Here is the problem; why in the world would beats be so popular if their sound quality lacks severely? My answer: Dre, and the fact that they are just cool and come in rose gold (in my case). The battery typically does last a Day, which I gotta say I love. The fact that they auto pair nicely with my phone is great too. I would recommend over-ear beats if you just have to spend the money tho, on ears do get uncomfortable. If I could do it over again, I would have lefts these overpriced headphones on the shelf.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I’ll get to the point.

Pros:

- Noise cancellation is superb. Nothing should disturb your music sessions with these on.

- Bass is adequate. Not earth shattering but good enough for a former bass head who had 10 inch subwoofers in my old Acura :-)

- Battery life is great. Didn’t have to charge these things for days.

CONS:

- Decibels could be louder. I tried these at max volume on all of my devices and was disappointed. Max volume should have your ears ringing but not the case here.

- mid range cords and vocals are lacking.

- The case requires effort to get the headphones inside. It should be effortless.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I have no complaints! Came in original box with everything as described. I’m not a headphone connoisseur and haven’t owned any others comparable to these so I can’t speak to how they measure up to others. I had been told they were of good quality so I got them, and I have enjoyed them so far. Easy to set up, and the charge lasts a long while. If you wear them for hours on end, your ears do get kind of sore, but i would expect that for any type of headphone like this. Does a pretty good job blocking out surrounding noise.

I bought these for my daughters birthday. I gave them to her yesterday. I ordered them on Amazon Prime day so the window for returning was August 18th. I assumed ( hoped) they would work directly out of the box. My daughter was so excited to get these and they don't work! One side of the headphones is silent. I am SO DISAPPOINTED and am wondering if perhaps they sent out faulty ones on Amazon Prime Day?

"I had this unit for more than a month before returning it. Right off the bat, I didn’t like the controls being on the left side. Most people are right handed. Why put the controls on the left?

I couldn’t locate the stupid thing after I had already put the headphones on. I felt like I was reading braille. I could not adjust it comfortably on my head, especially in the gym, in a good position w/o it falling every so often. I’d like to think I have a normal size head. On the plus side, the range (at least 60 ft.) and battery life (with 2/3 hrs of use per day could last a week w/o charging) was excellent.

Over long periods of time they start to hurt your ear and for instance, let's say you are laying in bed, u can't necessarily wear them while laying on your side, the only position u can wear them in bed is to face up. either way, these headphones are good, the only downside is to how long you can endure their uncomfortability that's all.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"overall, if i could go back and not buy this, i would. this is more of a brand type head set, i don't believe it's worth what you're getting. i've been told you can get some for 150 that sound better than this, and i'm looking into it myself. i feel cool walking around with this expensive head set, and i suppose it's not horrible, but as for someone who is not blessed with money, i would say don't waste your money if you're expecting $250 quality, i would say these are worth about 150 instead. battery life is amazing, a 5 minute charge can last me hours, and i can listen an entire week for several hours on a full charge with out needing to charge again. i give these a 3 because there is good qualities, but the price is just a deal breaker for me.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I wish it were possible to give lower than one star. Ordered one day delivery and they came in 2 days late. But,when they came they were white when I ordered black. No original packaging, they were dirty, and the bluetooth said Sam's beats. I complained to customer service. So they sent me another pair which worked great for one day. Bluetooth function failed. I only bought these bc my beats studio quit working beyond their hard reset. But, all beats are junk. Would never recommend to even my worst enemy or the annoying kids in xbox live.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I’ve been rocking old school wired Bose QC’s for years (and never write product reviews). As a frequent traveler I rely heavily on my Bose Noise Cancelling “capabilities” - not something these Beats really have. That said, I paid $130 for this lil set-up on Prime Day - fantastic deal. A “whole” day into wearing them and I’ve got to say it just may have been the best $130 I’ve ever spent (heck, they could fall apart tomorrow for all I know). First, I’m really kicking myself in the butt for not going wireless sooner - I’m always snagging the wires on something and popping the wire plum out). Wireless is so liberating!!! The range on these things is incredible. I’ve got a pretty big house and I haven't found a reasonable area where the signal poops out (w/o curling up in a closet upstairs w/ my ipad in the garage). Second, the sound - crisp, clear and plenty loud. I’ve not taken them off since getting them - No doubt that’s going to agitate my wife:). Admittedly I’ve always been a Bose fanboy (not an audiophile though) and dismissed Beats all together as “just another shiny object w/ a great marketing angle”. My kids of course only wear Beats and tell me how much of an old man I look like with my wired Bose phones. Finally, battery life “if as advertised”. I’ve got about 12 hours on these guys so far which already impresses me:). The only “Cons” (it applies to most on-ear phones) are Noise in - they're not Noise Cancelling nor are they advertised to be / and Noise out - I’ve been listening to these things a fair bit louder than I do with my other headphones - when I take them off I notice how loud they are potentially to those around me (going to need to keep the volume at a reasonable setting I suppose). These things rock though - I keep finding myself dancing around the house and I’m no dancer. Get a pair, you wont regret it.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Used them for couple months. They died like 4 months ago. Won’t charge, won’t turn on, only one side works when using aux cable. During the the time they did work they were great. Came in original beats packaging. Everything included. Got them during a daily deal so it was a great price. These are my second pair of beats. First were mixrs from Best Buy so I know they’re the same beats value. BUT After multiple cables I contacted Apple. Was thankfully still under warranty. Currently shipping for repair. Hoping it’s covered. I was skeptical about buying something like this on amazon. But if it’s a factory issue I would defiantly change my rating to a 5 because as of now I’m not sure what the issue is. I have read that solo 3s do have a lot of issues. Hoping for the best.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I've gone through a handful of over the ear headphone throughout the ears, always trying to save a few bucks. I finally splurged on these babies and it's my greatest purchase of 2019. My main use is for traveling, I can't ever sleep on planes or in airports and with these little monsters, I'm sound asleep in minutes. Half the time, I don't even put on music, I just ""activate"" the super power of noise cancelling and it's like magic. I do use them while at work and even after I've had them on for hours, they're still comfortable. For conference calls, I've noticed that the quality of input sound is much better than my airpods and I have never had any clients complain that I'm hard to hear. FIVE THUMBS and A MILLION STARS!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is fabulous. I purchased these for my husband after he kept taking mine! The most impressive feature is that they work great on your phone. I talk to clients using my beats each day and they work perfectly. Clients comment on how well they can hear me AND I can hear them crystal clear. Not only that but they are extremely comfortable whether using at the gym or for work.

Had for short time and barely used went to place on my head and plastic arm cracked. Placed back into case until returning home from trip and contacted amazon who nicely said since it was 2 days out of return period apple would warranty and nicely put me through to apple. Apple had me send back but said it was physical damage and would not cover (via a note in the return box without even contacting me). Contacted amazon again as they had requested if apple didnt help. Only response was to put me back through to apple who couldn't tell me the cost to repair and diagnosis could be 100 dollar fee(according to the note).,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Arrived when expected, arrived as expected. I'm a repeat buyer, this is my second pair of BEATS Solo3 headphones (the other one is still fine, I just keep one set in my home, and the other is for when I'm mobile/outdoors). The sound from these headphones is GREAT! They fit well and are comfortable. They're easy to connect to various devices (I've used them w/Samsung smart TV, iphones and ipad). They hold their charge for long periods and are easy to use (power button, adjust sound volume, mute button etc.). Highly recommend!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sounds is good but the headphones are super tight on my ears. Makes my ears hurt after wearing them to long. I should have bought the over ear version. They don’t cancel noise. The phone microphone is super sensitive and doesn’t cancel out outside noise. They are good for short use. Good sound and connect easily to my iPhone. I think Apple could have done a better job implementing more technology and comfort to these headphones. But then again they haven’t perfected the iPods, which I love but they need to fit in my ear better.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"Bought this product twice. Once in 2017 and again in 2019. The first pair fell started falling apart after 3 months (headphone material). The second pair lasted a few days over the 1 year mark and although this time they didn’t fall apart the power LED won’t shut off.

I tried all the different methods on their site and what others suggested doing, but nothing worked. I contacted beats support and they said I was out of the limited service warranty period so I would need to pay $129 to have them fixed or replaced.

I bought my first pair at $200+ and the second pair at $150 and now they want another $129 to fix a problem that seems to be an ongoing issue with their product due to poor construction. Aside from that, they sound good, which is why I feel inclined to give 2 stars, but based on my experience with these headphones that’s as much as I’m willing to rate it due to poor construction and warranty services.

If you’re going to buys these make sure to get an extended warranty or purchase them at Apple with AppleCare.",2.0 out of 5 stars
My son got these for his birthday. He loves them so much! He always has them on his head and loves the wireless feature. He can have his phone at one end of the house and go all the way to the other end of the house and it is still connected. He had an issue setting it up. You hit the button for 1 second for apple phones and 5 for android. The battery last a long time. He normally charges it at night but it last all day and isn't dead at night when he goes to charge it. The sound is incredible and it is so soft and light weight on the ears and head. I would defiantly recommend these to anyone or any age that loves listening to music or watching movies on tablets/phones.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The reason why I'm giving 3 stars is because the Apple support is great and they are arranging to give me a repaired unit soon, the sound quality is really good as well, and the battery life is crazy long.
I have used these headphone really not even 6 months of regular usage, I have not really over used them, I mainly had them on the pouch, but still, in less than a year they ended up looking like in the pictures below.
I am not sure at this point if this was faulty unit from the manufacturer or who knows what.
I never dropped the headphones, never use them while on the gym, to be in contact with water, but still.
The product on the sound aspect, has an amazing texture of base, lows, it really makes you immerse on the sound itself, I just wish this wouldn't happen. Hope this helps, as many other experiences might not be the same as mine.",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I generally like Beats headsets. The sound quality is great and they are elegantly constructed. This is the second Beats product I bought. The first one (Beats Studio Wireless Over-Ear Headphone) broke at the hinge after two years of daily, but careful use. I replaced them with the Beats Solo3, but they lasted exactly a year and six months before one of the speakers became intermittent and eventually stopped working completely.

"I won’t buy Beats merchandise ever again. The power button to operate the wireless function on these headphones quit working within a year and a few months of purchasing. Amazon would not stand behind a replacement.
I was told to call the 800 number for Beats, and they were not helpful either. They will not replace since the headphones are only 5 months past warranty. They should last longer than 12 months because they are not an inexpensive pair of headphones. Very disappointing.

What a waste of money. Its like they almost know in advance that you'll be stupid enough to hide these away long enough that the super short 30 day return period passes. And don't bother calling about how they don't work. They will just tell you that they can't help you or to call the manufacturer. Likely as not these are second rate and thus the deal. Remeber that in life nothing is this good; unless its broke.

"Everyone. Please do not buy any product from Beats. All beats products are made from China from really cheap materials and other things in the making of the product. So they are sold here in the U.S for an exaggerated high amount price, and it’s a big profit for the Beats company. Don’t fall into just the brand and it’s marketing strategies. Would you rather look for well-known brand or for quality headphones, proven to work and perform outstandingly? And these other outstanding products are even cheaper than Beats. Why, because the price for Beats is an unreasonable price. The Beats are not worth that price because it’s made with cheap materials. Always research first and read reviews. I was actually in Best Buy today and they told me that Beats are the worst earphones you can buy because of how cheap they’re made. Best Buy themselves even have countless statistics and proofs that the earphone they sell are legit and actually work.",1.0 out of 5 stars

Said theynm had a full charge but would never turn on again. Waited a few days and kept trying them. Called Apple to have them repaired and got nothing but horrible customer service. Apple just lost another fan. If they can't stand behind their products or at least build something that works longer than 4 months, they are no better than their Chinese Knock-offs.

Could have bought 8 pair for the price of these crappy beats.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Not a knockoff.
These are the best sounding pair of headphones I’ve ever owned, and the decision to purchase was not taken lightly because of the cost. Sound quality is amazing. I’m hearing lyrics I’ve never heard before.

The ONLY downside to these is comfort. They’re fine if I’m wearing them for only an hour at a time, but any longer than that and my ears start to hurt because of the pressure. It almost makes me want to consider saving up for a pair of over-the-ear Studios.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I take care of all the electronics I own. I've gone through maybe ten or fifteen pairs of earbuds so far. These beats aren't those earbuds, and they aren't like many headsets

This is a stupidly comfortable over ear headset with the sound and design to match its Apple product cost. It has lasted me seven months without any sign of trouble. It is sturdy, easily collapsible, and a fast charge for the one or two week charge you could get out of it, even with playing music everyday. Its bluetooth connection is crystal clear and easy to configure most of the time.

However, I am a six foot adult male with a big head. I should've gone with the Beats Studio 3 since its a much larger design for a little bit more money. I don't even remember how I broke the bands on the sided of the headset, though I'm keeping them together via tape. The cost to repair the headset IN APPLE STORE STYLE costs as much as the headset, which is ridiculous. Thankfully, my beats are still fully functioning, and I plan on buying another headset when I have the money.",4.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are great if you can get them to connect to your iPhone. It takes about 15-30 minutes every time you want to get them to connect to your Bluetooth. I’ve tried everything. My headphones power button will be flashing and my iPhone will be searching and nothing happens. You just have to keep powering off the headphones and turn them back on to flashing or keep shutting your phone off and turning it back on. The 15th time of doing a combination of those things will eventually work and it will connect.,2.0 out of 5 stars

Love the product however it had to be replaced because it would not charge correctly. Luckily the year warranty covered it. This is the second pair I have had. The first pair has one headphone that no longer works and it wasn’t under warranty so I am stuck paying $150.00 to get it fixed. Therefore I bought a extended warranty for the the current pair.

"I got these headphones to replace a Phillips brand that more than exceeded my expectations for the price I paid. I chose Beats brand because of their quality reputation and was really excited for their noise cancellation ability. While the unboxing was impressive and I enjoyed a full charge at arrival, these offer absolutely no noise cancellation as advertised. I bought two pair: one for myself and one for my kiddo. For the price I paid, I am extremely disappointed.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I purchased these to finally go wireless with less ports on my work machine than before and I got to use these for about 6 months before they stopped charging completely, rendering them useless as wireless headphones.

They’re very pretty, and the folding aspect with the case is clever. The wire for using them as wired is nice but, if I wanted wired headphones I wouldn’t have paid an extra $100 for these.

Additionally, it’s worth noting that you should be aware of the size of your head. I wear glasses and found these very uncomfortable to wear after an hour or two because they pushed the arms of the glasses into the sides of my head. I could get around it by pushing the arms of my glasses over the ear cushion but this obviously messed with my astigmatism prescription.

The charging problem is not a one-off thing. Do a web search and see that many people have needed to fix this and it involves cutting open the headphone to rewrite it yourself.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these because they were on sale for $140 that day. That’s a decent price for them. I wouldn’t pay much more though. They are a little tight and pinch my ears after awhile—my head is not huge.

After using it only 4 times, and within the first week of owning them, the material broke away from the plastic on the right side air phones as shown in the picture. Also, the headphones plastic cracked and split open and the backing to the auxiliary device mic fell off and wouldn’t click back on. I question the authenticity of this product.

"I will admit I am a long-time review lurker, but never actually post reviews here because I'm lazy. However, I felt as if I should give an honest review for these, as the holiday season is approaching.

I'm a HUGE music guy and have had a pair of Beats and every On-Ear model since they first rolled out. My Solo 2 wired in headphones got stolen out of my luggage and I recently got the iPhone 8, so I figured it was finally time to venture into the ""Wireless"" territory. I purchased the Solo 3 Wireless Gloss Black pair back at the end of September and everything came as expected and they looked awesome.

However, after 45 min at the gym and them being fully charged, they just turned off and would not power back on. I tried numerous Youtube videos of resetting them and charging them, but nothing. I chatted with an Apple associate and ended up bringing them in to the Genius Bar and even they were baffled at what was going on. I sent them in for repair and got them back a few days later and after one use the same issue occurred.

I then went to the Apple store again and we looked at everything, software on my phone, the headphones, etc, and they were still baffled. I sent them in again and they sent me a new pair. This new pair worked well, but would not power off (light always flashing) and also would not charge at all. Maybe it was just the Gloss Black style? I don't know.

Finally, after about a month of frustration, I sent them back to Amazon and searched forever on Amazon for a new pair of great wireless headphones (since I used gift cards to buy this), but could not find anything that had the fashion, fit and sound that I liked from my Beats.

As a loyal Beats fan, I insanely purchased a new pair of the regular Black Solo 3 Wirless beats and so far everything has been working amazingly, the sound is awesome, the battery life is insane and they fit perfectly for when I'm going running.

Moral of the story is these headphones are really great, but like they always say, ""third time was a charm"" and the whole process of getting there was a bit frustrating. Therefore, I caution on the side of buying any warranty on these, as all of my costs were taken care of and I didn't spend a penny extra.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm a headphone enthusiast and I love these headphones. I have Sennheiser 600HD's, amped, in ear monitors, in ear Bose headphones, and about 4 other cans.

I would say these are ""Fun"". They don't have a huge sound stage, but you can't expect a huge soundstage from on ear headphones. They sound great for Bluetooth headphones and they feel comfortable.

I originally bought these for use in the gym since I workout 6-7 days a week but honestly I sweat way too much and these only make it worse. If you're a sweater then don't get these on ear headphones, you'll be miserable, you'd probably be better off with the in ear power beats.

I give these 5 stars though because they just sound fantastic. And they have a 40 hour battery life. That's just wild to me. They are the best (or should I say the funnest?) Bluetooth headphones I've tried out so far and I tried out quite a few before buying these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Ok so I’m a really picky person when it comes to headphones, I have gone through jbl, skullcandy, Apple. You get the point, I’ve been through a ton of headphones, but these ones have satisfied me the most. Alright to my review, bass: bass is alright I’d say, enough to satisfy me, not to much not to less, I will be honest when this is at max volume, it will shake your head hard, but if you can’t handle that volume I do not recommend. Sound quality: this is what I love about them the most, their sound quality is litteraly crystal clear. absolutely recommended if you just want to hear every detail of the music and video that you are watching. Comfort: the insides are made of memory foam which is really soft when worn in warm temperatures, which is really good, the top part has padding. but when in a cold temperature it gets really hard and uncomfortable, so if your looking for headphones for a cold climate, I do not recommend these, I have a couple of friends who absolutely destroyed their headphones, like torn the leather from the headphones, but to prevent that, keep it in a case at all times you are not using it, don’t leave it on the floor, on a desk, basically anywhere without its case(provided). Noise cancellation: their is some to no noise cancellation on these headphones, so if your in a loud environment your going to hear it. Noise leakage: I have tested these in a quiet environment and no one will here you, ok if it is at like max they can here it but it’s like a whisper(friend told me). So if your looking to listen to this in like a library, these absolutely for you.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones were a splurge for me but turned out to be an expensive disappointment. Wireless solo3 right side stopped working after warranty expired. Took great care in keeping these headphones pristine and even bought an additional matching case. Fees to repair start at $130 with $7 shipping just to look at them. Waste of money and won’t be replacing them with Beats. I can buy better ones from other companies for less than the cost to repair or replace.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I reeeeeally wanted to like this. I have another brand already and heard my sister's Beat. I decided to get myself one. The sound quality does not justify the price. It is not far from the $37.00 wireless unit I have, but fine I was going to keep it anyways. Then the biggest obstacle was the functionality. On my headphones, I can easily maneuver back, forth and sound up and down. The Beats did not seem to have the feature. Nothing other than power on and off. I am rather computer savvy but could not make it work. Back to the MPOW unit. It functions better for me.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First off the connectivity of these is great. I was two floors above my phone and they performed like normal! I am an Apple user so that might be why it's so good. These are super comfortable and they fit my head super well! The battery life is no joke too, I charged them too 93 percent used them the entire day checked the battery and there was still 87 percent left! Once you put these on at about 5 or 6 volume everything else fades out. The controls on these are also super helpful. You can adjust the volume, activate Siri, pause songs (works with Spotify) and pick up and hang up calls, I mean what else could you want. These look super sleek on your head. I recommend the matte black because then they don't take fingerprints and scratches easily. One other thing is the mic. It might just be me but there is a slight echo so you can hear what you are saying. Everyone that I've called says that I sound great! In conclusion, these are a great pair of headphones and they are totally worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars

My wife uses these every time she goes to the gym - this is the first pair of expensive headphones that she is actually willing to use. Great battery life and works flawlessly with her iPhone. She is very pleased with the sound quality and it does a great job playing that hideous hip hop crap she listens to. Other reviews are luke-warm on this model but I can't agree with them - it's great value for money.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"it s the first time purchase an on-ear headphones so can not compare with other products. I have it for around 2 months now, sound quality is a bit above average, It has plenty of bass. like other Beats products, quality looks good. The battery life amazed me, 1 hour charge and I use it for 4-5 days, 10hrs/day. The range is pretty far, more than 50 yards I still have good connection. The only thing bothers me is that it hurts my ears after around 1 hour of using. I tried to stretch it by put it over a few book, then use hair dryer to heat it up, leave it over night. It helps quite a lot.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these for my hubby as a graduation present since the ones he had were the wired ones. Gave it to him for graduation and he originally didn't even use them for about a month. So, about 2 months after purchasing them the cover on the ear portion began to come apart. The thread just started to unthread and now you can see the cushion part of the ear. He doesn't even use them anymore. I am very disappointed as these headphones are not cheap and this was his graduation present for getting his Masters!",1.0 out of 5 stars
I got these for a trip and I still love them. They work very well and match my phone. They have a case so I can keep the cord and charger all together. They are adjustable and easy to set up. Noise quality is really great. These are not noise canceling ones but they block out noise well. They turn off in MN cold if you do Bluetooth but work just fine with the cord. There are many color options too.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The biggest quality these headphones have is by far how convenient they are and how easily they connect to an iPhone. They also look very good and the sound quality on these headphones is all right as long as you aren't expecting too much. The controls are also subtle and easy to reach.
However, I cannot recommend this product. The biggest problem with them is how fragile they are. After only six months of casual use, substantial damage is visible. Particularly on the headband, which lacks cushioning and tears very quickly. The other problem is the price. You can find headphones that accomplish the same job for about half the price when looking at brands like Sennheiser or AudioTechnica.
This product seems to be aimed at younger people looking for good looking and convenient headphones. I recommend that you save your money and look elsewhere for headphones that look just as good, sound just as good and are far cheaper.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Birthday present for my 15 year old, he absolutely loves them. I tried them myself and the sound quality is amazing. Couple of quick points:
1. do not have the audio cable plugged in when trying to turn on or setup Bluetooth. The cable needs to be left out in order to do that.
2. if you do use the audio cable, the 90 degree elbow end goes into the audio device and the straight end goes into the headphones. otherwise you will only get sound out of one side.
We had a couple issues initially, but that is only because we didn't follow the above two points. After figuring those out, the headphones work great. Great sound and decent comfort. Easy to setup.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I am constantly wearing headphones and wanted to switch it up by getting a pair of over the ear wireless headphones. I've been looking into getting Beats for a while and was excited to try these out!

1. I love the look of them! Thought I'd look hideous in over the ear wireless headphones but they're super cute and look great.

2. I love the optional cord to plug into devices (not the charger). Provides a nice option if you want to use that!

3. They're kind of comfy. Not the most comfortable I've ever experienced but decent. Maybe it adds to a little discomfort with the fact that I have multiple ear piercings that perhaps are a little smushed with these style of headphones.

4. The sound quality is AWESOME! So great.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"First off let me say that when they are not broken, they are excellent headphones. Sound quality, battery life, range, all of that is great. The problem is they are not durable at all. The first pair I owned, I had to send back to the manufacturer after 6 months due to the battery that all of a sudden stopped charging. It was under warranty so they were replaced. 9 months later the right headphone stopped working but because it was past their 1 year limited warranty (from purchase date) there wasn't anything I could do. I ended up giving them a second chance and buying a second pair, which lasted a little over a year until one side of the headphones (they are expandable) came clean off the headset. For $250 dollars I expect them to last longer than a year. I would suggest going with a different companies product unless you are comfortable replacing these every 12-18 months. All in all its been 28 months since I bought my first pair and now I need to buy a third set of headphones, it will not be from Beats.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Broke after a year. Nothing weird, just wouldn’t turn on one day. Sent them into apple for 130$ for service. After hours of dealing with the service department, they told me I “made product modifications” and they won’t fix them for the 130. These have never left the office. Essentially was accused of being some sort of bedroom hacker with my headphones? Stunningly ridiculous. They told me they’d fix them for $369. Not sure if they’re aware how much they are new? The whole experience is insulting, I won’t be buying more beats products.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I loved this product and gifted it to my wife for her birthday. Its been 5 months and she has barely used these. In the starting she mentioned that it gives her pain in the ear lobes, but i said may be she is not used to headphones so it takes time adjusting. Now she started back and has got a permanent pain in the lobes that hurts her in her day to day activities specifically sleeping as the ears touch he pillow. She has stopped using it now and this product is a waste for me. I want to return it back and need my refund but amazon will not entertain it now. It has created medical issues for my wife and the product is still almost new here. I invested money here and i m really really disappointed with the quality.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Full disclosure. I am an MPow guy that is very satisfied with the quality over my wireless headset. That said, I could not pass up on the deal during Amazon Prime Day. I got this headset for 55% off normal cost and have not been disappointed with my purchase. Very impressed by this headset. Mind you, I was the guy that would never spend $300+ on a pair of premium wireless headphones. At $146 you can't go wrong. ;)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these over three years ago and use mostly for travel and when I'm walking.
Had to take them to get replaced a little over a year ago because they stopped holding a charge and apple replaced when they could not repair. Well now the same thing is happening with the replacement. Couldn't get 2 years out of either head phone and since the one I have is a replacement no further warranty.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Really disappointed. When my wife first used these, running outdoors, they only lasted 5 minutes then shut down. She fully charged and tried again and once again, they stopped working after 5 minutes. Amazon replaced and the new pair is doing the same thing. I thought I was buying top-of-the-line equipment. By the way, the sound is good until they shut down. Honestly, I wouldn't buy these if you live up north where the outdoor temperature falls below 32 degrees.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Great product, until it stops working. 7 months use and no sound out of one side. Ear pads are also ripping away from frame and just look like material is crumbling.
Still under warranty, so we will see the fix they offer. Will update. At this point, not worth the price we paid, wouldn't buy again.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"Shockingly poor quality materials and subpar construction for a premium priced product from Beats (and Apple). The sound is solid - although they should get louder in my opinion - but after just a handful of months of ""light use"" they are literally falling apart. There are two places where the adhesive has worn off and the components are separating from each other. Keep in mind, I'm not some punk kid who doesn't care for his stuff, I'm a 40-year-old man who absolutely babies my electronics!",1.0 out of 5 stars
The first Beats Solo3 received did not work. They would not go wireless nor would they fully work while plugged in. They had many issues. Amazon immediately sent a replacement as I packaged and sent the return item. The replacement head phones were as expected and worked great! My son has enjoyed hours of listening time in the few days he has had them. The battery is amazing and he loves the sound and feel of the headphones. A definite recommend.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I like this product very much. I have to say when I saw the packaging it made me realize how high the standards were. The unboxing experience was top notch and couldn’t ask for better. The first thing I notice when I put these headphones on was that the earmuffs were really soft and comfortable. Then I paired these up to my iPhone and I couldn’t even imagine the simplicity apple has created to pair these beats to a device. Next I played some music. It was very high quality and they were better than any of the headphones I’ve had before, the highs and lows were very balanced. And do not worry about these being counterfeit because I was worried when I purchased them but when I paired the beats there was proof of the W1 chip because of the simple pairing. The battery life on this is also remarkable I didn’t have to charge these for weeks till they were dead. Overall I really recommend picking these up, bye and I hope u like your beats. :)",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these Beats headphones because they were on sale, and because I thought ""It's been a while since I had beats, maybe I should give them a second chance."" I should not have. I may be biased since I own high quality headphones, I have Bose QuietComfort 35ii and Sony WH-1000XM3s. I was expecting sound quality maybe just slightly below these with no active noise canceling since they were just on-ear and what I got was far below my expectations.

Sound Quality: 2/5
By no means are these the worse headphones I've ever listened to, but they are the worst headphones I have ever listened to at this price point. The trebles are just meh and that's the best part of these headphones. The mids sound like you're listening to someone else's party down the street or you're listening to someone else's music through a wall. It's atrociously bad and this is the worst part of the headphone. The bass is actually okay... until you have both bass and another range of sound playing at the same time. The bass quality is nice, and these really boost bass but you sacrifice washing out the rest of the song into a muddle mess and hearing nothing but slapping bass. This is fine, if you're a basshead and these headphones are GREAT when I'm listening to a bass-heavy rap song or EDM, but when I want to listen to anything else they're pretty trash.

Appearance: 3/5
These are beats and they look more like a fashion statement than any real headphones. Audiophiles will smirk as you pass by them because they know you paid way more than these are actually worth.

Comfort: 1/5
The clamping force is too hard for anyone to wear comfortably especially compared to what else is on the market for this price point. On top of that the materials used are super uncomfortable. The rubber headband pulls on your hair (and mine's short, I'm in the Marine Corps), the ear cups are stiff and made of some type of pleather probably, and after a half hour of wearing them (ONLY A HALF HOUR!!) I don't want to continue listening to these headphones since they push on my ears uncomfortably, grip my head and pull my hair (I'm not that into BDSM, thank you).

Ease of Access (iOS): 3/5
Ease of Access (everything else): 1/5

Connecting to an iPhone or iPad is a breeze, just turn the headphones on and bam you're connected for the most part. Sometimes it's a little finnicky. In comparison, the airpods have a much smaller form factor, better latency and better range.

Connecting to any other device is like trying to fight your mom; you'll probably win, but is it worth it? Definitely not. These will connect to your other devices, but in order to stop it from connecting to my iPad even when I had told my iPad to forget these headphones I had to take my iPad to another room and turn on these headphones outside with the device I wanted. Definitely cumbersome.

For full price of $299.99 these are just not worth it. Even for the discounted price of $160, they just aren't worth it.
Amazon has plenty of other well-priced headphones on the market...

For bassheads: Skullcandy Crusher Wireless ($120)
For flat EQ but good sound: Bose QuietComfort 35ii ($350)
For the best acoustic sound: Sony WH-1000XM3 ($350)
Best sound on a budget: Audio-Technica ATH-M50x (on sale for $130, but usually $150)

In summary, if you want convenient iOS headphones, just buy the airpods. If this is you're first time venturing into the expensive headphone market, I hope this review helped you move away from these headphones. I really don't know who these are for except people who were previously fans of the Beats line. If anything though, I think their sound quality has further degraded from when Beats was partnered with monster headphones. I hope this review helped!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are AWESOME! As a Mom, I am typically not a “name brand” kind of person. These were a gift from my husband and really a splurge, but I absolutely love them. Doing laundry, dishes, and other housework is much more enjoyable listening to music and these do not fall off my head like other headphones and earbuds I have owned in the past. So any Moms out there who aren’t sure about these, just go ahead and make the purchase. High quality, easy to connect, and well worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"love my headphones and if it gets soiled, I use a wipe or a damp soapy rag to clean it and it is a good as new. It cancels out everything and the battery life is as promised, I listened to my books when I’m cleaning the house, running errands, and doing choirs and I’m never worried that the battery is going to fail me. For how I use it you would think I would have to charge it daily, but I don’t. It’s a great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"This is my second pair of Beats and both stopped functioning after about 18 months. My last pair would not turn off. I did a factory reset that worked but now it won’t turn on.

I'm definitely a believer in everything else about them, so I hope they make future iterations that'll work for me!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I like the sound quality, the lightness, and I’m pleasantly surprised by the comfort level. I have previously owned Beats Solo 2’s Wireless and they did hurt my ears after wearing them awhile.

I’d say these were a great purchase at 129 dollars during the recent Cyber Monday event.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"These are HORRIBLE! I have gotten 2 different pairs for my fiancé. Both pairs will not hold a charge. When they do charge, the die very quickly. Disconnect from phone for no reason. Cannot even get to turn on anymore when they are fully charged. These are a waste of money and should be fraud for what the represent compare to what they provide to you. Two different pairs have done the same thing. It's the product in general. bad quality. Do not waste your money on these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros:
1- looks amazing
2- Loud sound
3- fair bass

Cons:
1- No Next/Previous track buttons.
2- Ears get too hot at gym because of the leather. I would really prefer if they made another sport line that contains cushion instead.

Concentrate on the performance & comfort. The only difference between Solo 2 & 3 is battery which doesn’t make sense",3.0 out of 5 stars
If you are a bass hunter or like dubstep this is for you otherwise look for better quality headphones low range is non existent or muffled and medium is there but super heavy on bass and the wireless works well but not long range enough the earpads are the same from other models so they will ware out better to buy replacements now or higher quality ones. You are buying the name not good headphones. Decent battery life.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"My nephews wanted these, and they love them. They sound okay to me, but I'd honestly look elsewhere if you want a high-quality, comfortable pair of headphones.

The bluetooth and battery life are the real pluses on these. The battery lasts forever, they charge pretty quickly, and the bluetooth has a really good range. The sound tends to be a bit bass-heavy and possibly muddy, and I don't know how comfortable they would be over a long session. I tried them out only for a few minutes and could only go off of my immediate impressions.

Depending on your genre preferences, these may be suitable. For me, I would look elsewhere.",4.0 out of 5 stars

These headphones sound really good like other beats headphones I have had. The problem with these headphones is how uncomfortable they are. If you are only using them for 30 minutes or so they are just fine. Anything more than that your ears will start hurting more and more. I don't know why they went with on ear headphones pads instead of over ear headphones. The studio headphones I have are over ear and they can be worn for hours without any discomfort.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"I really enjoy the convenience of these wireless headphones. They're easy to use and fit comfortably over my ears. They're not too heavy, which I was concerned about because I plan to run in them, and the collapsible arms are helpful for storage. In terms of sound quality, I don't feel that they're especially better than other good quality headphones, but they're good. The sound quality certainly isn't compromised at all. Whether intentional or not, they do have some noise cancellation effect also which I appreciate. Overall, pleased with my purchase.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I just ordered and received these headphones today (same day delivery with Prime). I'll start by saying they are authentic Beats (Fulfilled by Amazon). I purchased the protection plan just in case. That being said, i'm listening to music with these headphones as I write this review, and they are perfect.

They'll be gym tested tomorrow, but based on the fit, I don't anticipate any issues. A great first impression.

My granddaughter loved them. She plays the piano and can hook them up to her keyboard and listen to songs as she plays them back on the piano without bothering the rest of her family.

I order the headphones thinking they would do me justice on my deployment in Kuwait but I was wrong like way wrong. The first month they were perfect in every aspect of the word but out of nowhere one side went out and would barely work since. Two more months passed and then they just stopped working all together and since the warranty was with a 3rd party it just left me with broken headphones in the middle of my deployment. I will never buy anything like this from amazon again and amazon was my trusted source till now. So be careful what you buy and trust and believe these are trash.,1.0 out of 5 stars
90 days after purchasing the material began to tear away from the head piece. I took it to the Apple store and they replaced them only to have it happen within 90 days again. Warranty is now up and I refuse to order another pair or pay for them to be fixed. The quality does NOT justify the price and I’ll NEVER order another pair.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Power button stopped working after a little over a year, which after some extensive googling seems to be a very common problem with beats headphones.

Sad to have lost them, which I guess indicates something in their favor. But angry enough not to want to buy them again.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"Was looking to upgrade from my original solo’s and I’m incredibly pleased with the Solo3’s. These headphones are so aesthetically pleasing! I got the Satin Silver color and I am so happy with how crisp they look. These are more comfortable than the original Solos and seem to be constructed in a more solid manner (I threw in a picture of my old white Solos for comparison, which might I add lasted me SEVEN years without trouble, hoping for the same longevity with the Solo3’s). The Solo3’s sound awesome and the pairing capabilities are lightining fast due to the w1 chip that allows for speedy pairing with Apple devices. I will update once I’ve had these headphones for longer to report on their durability and battery life. Extremely happy with my purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars

These headphones are really nice. The bass isn't too crazy but enough where it doesn't disort it. The sound overall is pretty decent. They connect easy and have impressive battery life.

The sound quality and build quality aren't nearly as good as what you get for this price from Bose, Sennheiser or Grado.

I love the headphones in general but have found that after 30 minutes of use and they make my ears hurt. They push against my piercings into my cartilage to be quite sore. I have attempted to get replacement ear cushions in hopes of getting some a little bigger but if you change ear cushions then it voids warranty. They also do not offer replacement ear cushions from beats. So in my case they have not been worth the money I spent on them. I attempted to allow my 11 year old to use them and he states it hurts his ears also. Might be just us might be a issue for others as well. I would go with the studio headphones if you getting them over the ear.,3.0 out of 5 stars

I have had these headphones for almost 2 weeks now and I love them! They are able to connect to all of my devices via bluetooth with no issues and they hold a charge for a long time. I use them for hours on end and haven't had a problem with the battery getting low or dying on me. The sound is also great. The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because they are a bit tight on my ears and it starts to hurt after about an hours use. I ordered the gloss black which I feared may look cheap or leave fingerprint marks but it actually looks very nice in person and doesn't get dirty easily.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"These headphones are awesome for working out in a crowded gym– noise cancelling enough to block out all the other machines without having to turn up my music to dangerously high volumes, big enough to signal “don’t talk to me”, and adjustable so they don’t fall off my head when I’m doing abs or something (a big problem for me, I have a tiny and weird shaped head). Plus, the matte black is very pretty (in my opinion). Plus, the automatic connection from the W1 chip to my iPhone is a MAJOR bonus over the older models; otherwise, I can’t tell much of a difference from my old Solo2s. If you don’t have an iPhone, maybe save your money and go for an older model, but if you do, then the W1 is an amazing investment. Overall, I love em!",5.0 out of 5 stars

Great color and was waiting to get these when I could afford it, but these are $110 less than I have seen elsewhere so became my birthday present to myself! Convenient with a carry case.

"Bought as a gift and my husband LOVES them! He likes to listen to house music so the bass is a huge deal. He could not stop talking about how incredible they are.

- Disconnecting in the middle of work online meetings and webinars
- Currently, both pairs are NOT WORKING!!!

I am utterly disappointed, upset and I would never EVER recommend this product!

I tried adjusting them, taking out my earrings or just moving them around in general. The only thing that helped was taking them off. I was so disappointed and had no choice but to return them. They were no good to me if I couldn't wear them for more than an hour at a time.",2.0 out of 5 stars

Two weeks without charging. Everyday use. The only down fall is the case in which the headphones come.

"Can’t say enough about the battery life. Bought them for my 12 year old who consistently is hooked up to wired headphones. He uses them for hours during the day and hasn’t had to charge them in 3 weeks. They still have 53% battery life left. Specifications say 70hr battery life but I really didn’t expect it. Only downfall is, the case provided with them is a soft case and not very protective so I would definitely consider spending an additional $10 on a hard case for them.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Everything was great—worked just as described, looks good, excellent sound quality and very comfortable.....and then if got cold. Not crazy cold—it’s just 25F —just below freezing. They just shut off. Very sad as I planned to use them for winter hikes and cross country skiing....I would give it a 5 star rating if I lived where it was warmer all year.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Beats Solo3 Wireless do not disappoint at any aspect. Great sound, long battery life, easy to use, very comfortable, looks awesome. We are price sensitive buyers and we would like to get our money's worth. These headphones are a good value-for-money purchase. We gave this as a gift to our son and he loves it! It's really hard to get these out of his hands and I ""borrow"" them whenever I get a chance. I am looking at getting a pair for myself, too.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"My biggest complaint is that for an iOS device there’s no iOS App. You have to go into Widgets and add Battery in order to see the level. Another issue is it should either charge via lightning or USB c cable, not micro USB. I understand it was bought from someone, but they could have changed the way it charges to be in line with Apple products. Other than that, I like the sound very much. The price was very reasonable. The battery life is awesome,",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Very uncomfortable headphones, super tight and rigid. After just 2-3 hours use on plane, my ears hurts like hell and I have to take it off. By comparison bose headphones are so much more comfortable you don’t even feel like they were there, I regret deeply trying to save some money and not getting the Bose instead.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was a little worried about if I would be able to use these headphones for all my gym activities, but no longer! The color is amazing, bass and sound quality are perfect, and the Bluetooth connection (including how far you can walk away from your phone) work great for me. I ran in these and they didn't even budge. People were talking about the plastic on these, but the quality seemed great to me. Nice and light as well which I can appreciate in the gym. Love these headphones.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These lasted less than 3 months! Do not buy these. The quality of the product is obviously lacking. The number of people that report them breaking says a lot. For everyone that comes back and writes a negative review there are probably 10 that have problems. They work great initially, but simply do not last anywhere near long enough to merit the cost.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"1-Does not sync well with my Android phone, there is a constant clicking noise when linked ith blue tooth, and when linked with wire, sound is only in one ear. Ok for podcasts not for music.
2-works great with my tablets, no complaints
3-headphones too small, does not cover entire ear, sits on top of my ear",3.0 out of 5 stars
Tengo tres meses que los compre y ya no sirven me salieron de muy mala calidad no recomiendo que los compres😡😡,1.0 out of 5 stars
I love these headphones. I wear them to the gym regularly and use them for work conference calls. What blows my mind is I've only had to charge them maybe 4x in the several months that I've had them! Amazing product. The only negative is that they become a little uncomfortable after about 40 min esp if you're wearing earrings. But most of them do.,5.0 out of 5 stars
Super easy to sync with my iPhone and iPad. Good quality sound for a wireless set. The range and battery life are amazing. I can leave my iPhone in my locker at the gym and roam the whole building during my workout without losing signal. The only negative is that they make my ears a little warm when I wear them while exercising.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"The sound quality is amazing and the battery duration is very long lasting.

I loved mine while they lasted. Now only one side works when I connect it through bluetooth. The head pad that it has is going to come off really fast after you use them for a couple of months.

As people have pointed out, it's just dissapointing that you're paying a premium price and you're not quite what you expect.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for my Wife - she loved them so much I bought another pair (not pink!) for myself and I have to say that overall, when paired with iPhone, they are amazing. Extreme battery life. Fast charging and sync very nicely.

I did have to buy earphone covers to use them for running though as they have a moisture shutoff that triggers if you sweat a lot.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I travel a ton for work and rely on headphones that will reduce the white noise of the planes engines when attempting to watch movies/shows or listen to music. These headphones were great at achieving that and super great in instantly connecting with my apple products. Two stars were taken off for general build quality as the connection point for the right ear broke upon adjustment after just a few months. Would consider buying new model if build issues were resolved.,3.0 out of 5 stars
"bought for 13 year old son for his birthday. This was the best price I could find after looking around online and in local stores. I wasn't entirely sure my son would like the gold color, but he was thrilled by them and they're much more fun than the basic black. He's had them almost two months with lots of daily use. I like that they come with a case to take them along with us in the car or traveling.",5.0 out of 5 stars
Beats delivers amazing quality in their solo 3 wireless headphones. Long lasting battery life and quick charges allows for tons of listening time. High quality sound and a beautiful Disney design makes these great for any music and Disney fan.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"Headphones worked fine until sliding function broke. We used tape to hold it in place. Sent the product in and they refused to honor the warranty because applying tape was an ""unauthorized modification"". The tech couldn't care less and I've heard this is commonplace for Apple. They have your money...and guess what...they will gladly send you a new pair at ""market value"" which is currently $40 more than I paid for them. They broke within 2 months of ownership. Guess my son will have no headphones for his virtual school he is forced to attend. Thanks Apple for your compassion and commitment to reliability!",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I was very hesitant on buying Beats because normally they're heavy on the bass and muffled on the treble. Not with the Solo3. These were extremely well rounded in the Bass/ Treble. Don't get me wrong, these headphones have a lotta Bass at a high volume and the treble is adjusted acoustically to sound normal and not muffled. At a low volume, the treble jumps out at you with a crystal clear sound and the bass is adjusted to a low roar.

The weight is pretty well distributed. They sit pretty well on your head with no extreme tightness on the ears or the head. Yes, they sit on the ears instead of over the ears. I didn't realize this until I received them. I have used some like this in the past and didn't care for the feel or the sound of them. Once I tried on the Solo3, I could tell this wasn't the same story like in the past. The leather padding is great. A pillow - like feel on the ears makes these comfortable to wear for hours. Adjusting them is very easy also. Just pull , right above the headphone, up or down to fit your ear height. Also the headphones fold inward for easy storage.

Battery usage is definitely a plus on these Beats! Their claims that it last about 40 hours is right on target. The first time I used them, the battery lasted about 38 hours but after I charged them it went as long as 42 hours on a single charge so go figure. The 10 minute fast charge does last a good 3 hours so that is definitely a plus in my book.

As for looks, you can't go wrong. Typical Beats good looks, just packaged in a smaller size. I went with the flat or matte black. I don't care for the ""fingerprint"" look so I didn't go with the glossy black because reviewers say it is a fingerprint magnet.

Connection is a breeze with Bluetooth and even better if you have the iPhone 7. If you don't have the iPhone 7 or iOS 10+ then Bluetooth connectivity is as usual: turn on the Bluetooth on your device and look for Solo3. For IPhone 7 or iOS 10+ just turn on the Bluetooth and connect it once and your iPhone will remember the Solo3. Now, the next time you turn on your Beats headphones it will automatically connect to your iPhone.

The Beats Solo3 package came with its own storage bag, USB A-to-USB micro-B for charging and a male to male 3.5mm cord to use the headphones without the use of the Bluetooth.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Not sure what the previous buyers received but I just got these Solo3 headphones December 2019 and they are phenominal! I was nervous ordering them after reading the previous reviews, but I’m SO glad I ignored them in this case. The packaging is legitimate and everything that is supposed to come with them comes with them. The sound is A++ and the noise cancellation is perfect! Buy them! They are worth it!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These aren’t advertised to be noise-canceling, so I’m not sure why I’m asked to rate that aspect. My only complaint is that the ear cups hurt my ears over time; I’m not sure why they’re smaller than the Beats and Beats 2 I also own. I love the sound and the wireless feature - holds a charge forever!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I use my beats every day to listen to music, podcasts, and audiobooks.

You do have to break them in though, they hurt really bad for the first few days after only an hour or two of wearing and I have a small head.

They also get stretched out and then become too loose, so I can't use them to work out or really do anything but sit or walk while wearing. I don't even trust wearing them while washing dishes because they'll slip forwards off my face.

I love my beats but I wish they were designed to fit better.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I got these things as a gift from my wife last Christmas. By June the black cover around the ear piece began to fall off. Called in and covered under warranty and replaced no problem. Fast forward 6 months doing same exact thing but warranty no longer applies after they are replaced once. Definitely won’t buy this brand ever again. Shortly after the foam wore off they completely quit working on the right side. Technically $200 for 6 months of use,1.0 out of 5 stars
"These Solo3 will not disappoint! If you're looking for headphones with crippling bass these ain't it. However, the balance of sound from high, low and mid is amazing! The bass doesn't drown out the others, nor do the others cancel the bass effect. Just a well rounded pair of headphones. Love them!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I didn't read the reviews before purchasing these, but after hitting the purchase button I decided to go through some and see if there was a common issue. Well, I kept seeing that people were reporting getting fakes/refurbished products. So I became alarmed. They were same day delivery so when I got home and saw the box I was nervous I was sent fakes or refurbished headphones. Well after doing thorough research and watching several youtube videos, I discovered they were in fact real. I have had them for a week now and my only complaint is that they are a bit tight over my ears where my glasses are, but I suppose that's my bad for wearing glasses. Otherwise, they hold a charge forever, my last beats (purchased new at Best Buy) only lasted maybe 6-8 hours. These can go a few days which is nice. The sound quality is good, though they are not noise cancelling. I didn't need that since I mainly use these in my office at work, and I want to be able to hear if someone knocks at my door or walks in. Overall, pretty good!",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought this for my son. Who said the sound is excellent. The ear muffs ""just"" covers the ears. but this is fine watching my son who plays D1 HS Basketball he'll take this off and leave around his neck. Because the ear muffs are small it doesn't get in the way under his chin. We tested the range some bit. No problem about 30ft. away. Sound and stream was still excellent. of course you'll always have the disance limitations set forth with Bluetooth tech specifications.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They were beautiful and great sound but hurt my ears. I ended up returning these and getting a really nice pair of off brand, over the ear headphones and they are much more comfortable than these and have just as equally good sound quality and noise cancellation. It was very disappointing these didn’t work out.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Pros: These headphones have great quality sound.
Cons: they smash my ears so after wearing them for any period of time my ears are sore. Overall they are not comfortable to wear. Additionally the case that they come in is ever so slightly bigger than the headphones so they have to be put in the case perfectly to fit.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"These are great quality headphones. I have owned a bunch of Beats headphones in the past but this is my first wireless pair. The bluetooth function works great and they can be converted to wired headphones just by plugging in the included wire. Sound clarity is amazing along with the bass. The only issue I have with these, as with all solo's, is that after having them on your head for an extended time they will hurt your ears/ make them sore. I would opt for he studios if you can.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Really happy with the product. The only downside is that they sent the wrong color ( it was supposed to be gold and they are rose gold) unfortunately I leave to see my family next week and could not return. They are a gift for a boy so it’s kind of sad. Other than that, they work great!",3.0 out of 5 stars
"For $200 I expected these to last longer than 3 weeks! Within a 3 week time span the sound went completely out in one ear and was off and on in the other ear, by week 5 there was no sound coming out of the headset at all! They were a birthday gift to my son and I have not been able to get them replaced or repaired, so I just wasted $200. I will never trust Beats ever again!",2.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these headphones for my sons birthday last November. He loved them. Couldn’t be happier. About 2 weeks ago he started having trouble with the right headphone. Sometimes he could hear out of it and sometimes he couldn’t. It finally gave out. He was so sad and I was frustrated because the 12-month warranty is about to expire. I contacted the company I purchased it from on amazon and they were wonderful. Answered my email right away and they should be sending replacement headphones. I’m

"I ordered these beats because I could no longer wear my airpods with my new tragus piercing. The sound quality is great and the battery seems to last a really long time. My biggest complaint is that these are super uncomfortable for my ears. they hold on tightly and it’s like my ears are sore when I take them off. If it weren’t for that, I’d give them 5 stars. The color is nice and they seem durable.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Love my beats. Sounds great, easy to connect to my S8 phone or iPod. Battery last long. Charges fast. I use it during my train ride to work or workouts. My only regret is getting them in silver where the earpiece is white. They get dirty and you have to be careful cleaning them without damaging it. Otherwise, it's a great product.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm not going to delve into the subjective territory of sound quality. I will say that the sound is rich and performs better than expected (especially given Beats' history of emphasizing bass). The battery life is stellar and Bluetooth connection has been impeccable with amazing range and only rare hiccups. My one complaint is that it is a snug fit on my ears: after 1-2 hours, they actually start to hurt my ears a little.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Bought these for my son who wrestles. He rocked these before 87 individual matches to get pumped up. No complaints. No issues with sweat. Great batter life. He's completely 100% content. 3 star on noice cancelling, but they aren't advertised as such. Eveything else is great.",5.0 out of 5 stars

SO happy with my purchase!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I waited so long to buy the headphones. I tested them at an Apple Store and was amazed by the sound fidelity and bass. Even my wife was impressed. But I wasn’t in a good financial status, so I skipped the purchase at the time. That was last year. I heard about Amazon Prime days and decided to wait. The Solo 3 was the 1st thing that popped out when searching for electronic devices. And for $139 this time I would not let it pass away. Simply the best headphones that I have bought. And let me tell you I have bought many.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Good quality sound, looks nice, but cheap quality. However the first one I got malfunctioned with virtually no physical damage. I got a replacement. However the replacement broke a few months later again with no physical damage. I am disappointed.

"Let’s start with, I love Mickey. I definitely waited for the price to drop because (sorry, not sorry) Beats just isn’t worth it. The Mickey print is a beautiful matte. I really adore them but of course the sound quality/clarity just isn’t there.

I got these on Prime Day for a discounted price. I am not a headphone connoisseur but I was looking for something that was a little more suited for the office than my wireless in ear headphones I use at the gym. I have a loud intern that sits next to me who is the life of the office and needed something to block the noise out. It works. A little too well sometimes. I jump out of my skin at least 4 times per day when someone touches my shoulder or I see them out of the corner of my eye. Works for me.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I've been a content user of corded, over-the-ear-headphones forever, always barely tolerating the cord getting hung up on my office chair several times a day... I've also been a bit of a snob about the Beats brand, shunning the brand hype and the expense. Not sure what put me over the edge, but I couldn't be happier that I made the leap/cut the cord. These headphones are fantastic. Battery life is excellent - I've had them for about 2 months and the battery still is half-charged. Great bluetooth range, superb sound. I use them daily at my desk job and at home (yard work, wood working projects, etc.). The controls on the headset are slick as well.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love these things because they cancel out loud, obnoxious noises (like your animals whining while you're trying to focus and study for a big test). They are also very comfortable to wear. I've had on-ear headphones in the past that were so tight they gave me a headache. I could wear these all day studying if I needed to!",5.0 out of 5 stars
I was surprised by the solo 3s good sounding. Use them as workout headphones. Not worth 300 but got them on sale and they are good sounding plenty of volume not to bass heavy but got good sound and bass to them. And still using them to work out with no problems. Of course they always go back into the case.,4.0 out of 5 stars
Excellent fit powerful sound I actually gave these to my daughter she wanted some wireless headphones for when she works out at the gym these have met her expectations and more they are very comfortable she said I have tried them on and they are very comfortable with that and the sound is great if you’re looking for the beat sound with the wireless capability then I would recommend these,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I really like these headphones overall, the sound quality is good and they're decently noise-isolating. HOWEVER, I've had them only for about a year, and the battery life and their condition has declined significantly. While previously I only had to charge them once a month (with use for HOURS daily) now they barely last a few days. In addition, one of the side hinges is broken, and that side of the headphones doesn't stay collapsed, and will kind of swing out at random. In general, I like these, but please be warned that they probably won't last much more than a year and a half with normal use. Personally, I think they're far too expensive to have declined this quickly.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these in November of 2018. It’s June of 2020 and they are already broken. One ear isn’t working at all and the other if I press on it it will work otherwise it goes in and out and sounds like static. For the price, they should last a lot longer than what they did. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these head phones precisely for the noise cancellation feature. My spouse has to have the volume so high while watching tv I was in Hope's of being able to cancel out the sound and listen to another device while being able to say in same room as the tv. Did not cancel noise.,2.0 out of 5 stars

I wear these headphones everyday to the gym and have been wearing them for a long time now. the sound quality is still amazing. the battery lasts extremely long and it charges very quick when low. one of the earphone covers just started to come undone but with the amount I have been wearing and sweating in them they still work amazing.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I absolutely love these headphones for my workouts. I previously had ear plugs and they were constantly coming out of my ear whenever I sweat so I would have to frequently stop my workouts to put back and readjust them in my ear which got super annoying when i'm trying to concentrate on burning some fat. I've been using these for about a week now and they are really great, i can focus on my workouts and the sound quality is totally bomb. i won't go into all the specs and technical mumbo jumbo cuz i don't know them, but if you're looking for something that stays put and has good sound quality and long battery life you can't go wrong with these.",5.0 out of 5 stars

For a couple of days temperature dropped down under 32 deegres Fahrenheit and I have difficulties to use my headphones outside my apartment. After 5 minutes outside, headphones switching off by themself. I can not turn them back on until, I am back to a warmer place for at least 5-10 minutes. I sent a message to Beats by Dre tech support, and I received an answer saying the optimum temperature for using this headphones is above 32 deegres Fahrenheit. So it means that I not gonna be able to use this product through the winter. On my opinion Beats shoul inform customers that they could expect difficulties using this equipment in the cold environment.",1.0 out of 5 stars
I have tried a few different head phones but wanted blue tooth and smaller ear cup size so it didn't look weird while I listed at work. For the price I really dont notice a great sound difference from something like my BOHM headphones at a third of the price. I have glasses and these things kill my ear as they are so tight with no way to loosen them. I would have expect more out of something so pricey.,3.0 out of 5 stars
They were working well the first 2 weeks and then everything went down hill. The sound would start failing in the right ear until it was completely gone and I could only hear from one ear. Then it wouldn’t connect to the Bluetooth on my phone. And after a while I had to call amazon for help on what to do because I had it for a little over a month.,2.0 out of 5 stars
"Best wireless headphones hands-down! These are the easiest plug and play headphones ever. Right out of the box, they come with easy to start instructions, how to use the buttons and connect blue tooth. I was up and running in less than 2 minutes. They also fold really well into a case that is included. I'm really happy with the sounds, and they are very much noise-cancelling in my opinion even though I'm not sure it's advertised to be. Very comfortable, long battery life and well worth the money!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"They look great. If looks are your thing, grab these. If you don’t really care about looks and sound quality is your thing then you can definitely find something better for this price. That’s the biggest issue with Beats.. Price. But even then, the sound isn’t bad, just not good enough for the price.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Poorly made headphones. While the sound quality and noise cancelation are great, within six months of use the padding cover started coming off. For the amount of money spent on these, that shouldn’t have been an issue. I had knockoffs that lasted years.",2.0 out of 5 stars
"First problem may not be 100% Beat's fault, however, they are an Apple product. They don't play nice with Bluetooth. Failure and intermittent connection, dropped connection, both on Apple computers. Maybe not Beat's fault, but they are useless for the intended purpose if unable to establish a reliable Bluetooth connection.
Second problem, they are uncomfortably tight on the ears.
Third, the on/off switch offers no tactile functionality. The headphones must be removed and looked at in order to power on (or off).
The sound quality and noise cancelling are fine, but so is every other brand.",3.0 out of 5 stars

I love the Beats brand. They never fail when it comes to great sound. The quality of these headphones are great. They are very durable. The color is my favorite so that is great too.

This is my second pair of beats and they are only getting better.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my second set of Beats, the first Blue tooth. These are super comfortable, and easy to install on both my iPhone and iPad. However, since I live in colder climate, if the temps are in the upper to mid 30s, the headphones only last 15 mins at the most. Even if I wear a hoodie, they don't last much longer. This happens when the battery is fully charged, so there must be a shutoff when the headphones hit a certain temp. The battery doesn't drain, it just turns off. I would not buy these again.",2.0 out of 5 stars

I connect them via Bluetooth as I have on very flight and the right earphone has no sound. I spend every minute u til takeoff trying to google remedies and disconnect/reconnect and reset. I didn’t get them wet, used the case religiously. If I had known they wouldn’t last 13 months I would not have spent that much. Very disappointed.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"Stylish and sound great, but stopped working properly after less than a year. One of the ears goes in and out depending on your head position. A wire is probably a little loose on the inside.

Luckily they still had 6 days left on their one year warranty and Apple repaired them for free.",3.0 out of 5 stars

All kidding aside the headphones themselves are very nice. They have amazing sound quality, and they look and feel great. It took my daughter all of 3min to connect to her phone, set them up, and start listening to music.
Will buy another pair for myself, so that I can pretend not to hear my wife.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"These are my first over the ear headphones. They pair easily with my iPhone and my Microsoft Surface Laptop for calls and music on both devices. The sound quality is good and people say they hear me clearly. I haven’t tried outdoor calls yet where it may pick up other environmental sounds.

Next time I’ll consider spending more for more comfortable headphones.",4.0 out of 5 stars

Bought these for my sons birthday and he absolutely loves them!! I don’t personally use them but my son loves them he uses them all the time and has not once complained about them. They work as described. Well worth the money and the smile it has put on my sons face. I recommend these beats!,5.0 out of 5 stars
"My cousin needed these for her birthday, so I bought it for her. It was pretty good, she liked these so much. I have also tried these myself and over all sound quality is very good. The bass is okay, but not much deep bass with these. However, these do have the noise cancellation feature which is very good and works very well. Overall, I would say my cousin likes these.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Have wanted an excellen pair of Dr. Dre's Beats..especially before they became impossible to find.
These DO NOT disappoint! Noise cancelling, perfect (adapts to background). Clear sound with great bass that doesn't overpower!
Couldn't be happier with this product! I'll update this review if I'm not completely satisfied with my headphones!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these expecting to get quality sound but was very disappointed , the sound was like a cheap headphone, the fit was tight and uncomfortable and my ears left hot after a hour of use, i use them for a day or two and then stop using them, i gave them to a family member.",3.0 out of 5 stars
"Love love love, been wanting to purchase one of these for a while, saw it in some other sites but was expensive. Beautiful, sounds great and I like the fact that it folds and comes with a little carry on case.
Won’t trade it for nothing, still enjoying it and no problems so far. I think it’s the best by far.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"First thing that stood out to me was the color. I am a rose gold addict lol. The next thing was how comfortable these are. Those squishy ear pieces are amazing. The battery on these seem to last forever, which is great! The sound is crisp and clean. The only thing I'm disappointed with is the bass... there just isn't enough.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great sound and are compact so they are able to fit into smaller bags when they are folded. The battery lasts pretty long, I was quite surprised. I hardly ever have to charge them and I use them almost daily for the gym. The only complaint I have is they're not comfortable when wearing with glasses. They're a big snug on the ear so they do start to hurt a little when wearing your glasses.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Your used headphones purchased at full price may come with cat fur, earwax and dandruff like mine. That’s nasty.
Also, no cords included for these Bluetooth headphones. Just the used headphones in the case inside the beats box.
This is the second pair I’ve ordered and really not worth the hassle. Disappointed in Amazon’s quality control.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"I love these headphones! The battery is amazing, I didn’t charge it for the first month or so that I used it, and sound quality is also great. I mostly use them in my studio while working, super comfortable to wear for a long time.
I did not had any problems with the shipping/packaging. The box was in great condition, unopened, in original packing and everything was included.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great headphones. A little tight on ears at first, once broken in amazing sound, excellent battery life, and very comfortable. I have 3 pairs of wireless headphone and these are by far my favorite. If your in the market at 200$ range, stop buy these and be happy.

Also, these block out the world around you. Not recommend for long walks on a busy road with no side walk, you will not here it coming!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I'm very pleased with my purchase! Easy to connect to my Samsung S8 plus. My Beats came fully charged, and I've been using them since I took them out of the box! I've been to the gym and on public transportation! They don't necessarily block out background noise, but they're a great distraction! I am very happy! Don't think of the price! You only live once, and these headphones make life great! I definitely recommend these awesome headphones!",5.0 out of 5 stars
This is a good stuff. I've used it for a long time. Not any issues. But I don't know how to discuss it. I just want to clean up the review. Because when I look at the review which hasn't reviewed that I will feel uncomfortable. That's it.,5.0 out of 5 stars
I got the glossy black. Love this product. It's legit. Battery lasts a long time. Glossy black does not scratch easily. I even hit it HARD against a piece of equipment at the gym and the dent is still so tiny and not noticeable - so it is DURABLE.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"My husband loved these. They were great with his low hearing. However, they do not stand up to use while working. They have never been wet, always kept in the case. And just after the end of warranty they quit working. We think it’s because they couldn’t stand up to use while sweating. Can’t come up with any other reason for them to just quit like that after being so well taken care of. It was almost like they shorted. He was wearing them and everything was fine mowing then lawn and the boom, they were dead.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"I bought these as a gift. When I opened them, I was disappointed to see that the black material did not completely cover the ear phones on either side. The beige foam sticks out all around the ear phones on both sides. When I try to stretch the black material across the earphone to cover the foam—it won’t go--it’s WAY too small and will not stay in place.
If they don’t bother to refurbish them enough to make them look good on the outside, it’s doubtful that quality work was done inside. NO ATTENTION TO DETAIL.

"Best bluetooth headphone. Period. Quality is good but most important is you dont need to pair unpair anymore in order to connect to your phone, mac, ipad, watch. It connects to all at once and while listening music from mac if you get a call on iphone then you can just switch to iphone and vice versa. This is a great feature. When I go for jog then I just connect to my watch without unpairing. I have two and my daughter loves it as she can use between her laptop, phone and ipad.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Was 92% charged when I put charger on and charged for about 10 min and they were ready to go. I’m very satisfied! I got the matte black, looks classy. These are a plus for me since those dang iphone buds don’t fit in my ear. Love, love, love!",5.0 out of 5 stars
"I love color and they where awesome to 4 times I got to use them. Bought these a year ago in January
I have taken very good care of them . I charged them last night so I could use them today and they would not pair. the pair light wont even come on. so I plugged them in to use and sound only comes out on the right and nothing on the right ! In my opinion . 300.00 is way to much to spend on something you only got to use 4 times. Ive had cheap ear phones that last way longer and when they bite the dust you can afford to replace them . Very Disappointed in this purchase",2.0 out of 5 stars

Please look at the pics before you make a purchase decision.",1.0 out of 5 stars
Material around the are ear headphones are separated after reading many reviews there seems to be ongoing problem I called Apple but they want to hold a credit card on file and have them mailed in.

Called support and walked me thru the reset steps, which i had already done, now they say send it in. i'M SICK OF PAYING BIG BUCKS (224.00) NOT HAVING IT FOR MORE THAN 2 YEARS AND HAVE TO GET IT REPLACED.

"Great headphones for all purposes unless you plan on wearing them when the temperature drops near 32°F or below. These headphones have a wonderfully long battery life, effortless connections to I-devices, good sound and great usability. My problem, and it’s a big one, is that is impossible to use these headphones as a wireless device when the temperature drops close to or below freezing. At that point, the headphones turn off automatically anywhere from 5 minutes to 20 minutes later depending on how cold it is. Sometimes, when the temperatures only at 32°, I can get up to 20 to 25 minutes before they turn off. I have called Apple and I have been told that this is typical for battery powered wireless headphones. I have not substantiated this statement with other brands.",3.0 out of 5 stars
For the price doesnt sound that good its just ok it lacks mid its mostly bass its not worth $199 or $129 on sale .jbl live 400 sounds better for $ 69 ..but quality its really good.im not sure im keeping it ill try for a week will see,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Super great headphones ever have. Was having a wired Philips and a SONY headphone, but always felt painful on both ears because wrapping too tightly to ears. This Beats Solo3 doesn't make such problem to me.

In terms of BT/wireless, it works wonderfully as I have many apple products and the Solo3 connects to all of them with easy set up and very good music quality. The long durability of battery juice and long distance of reception make me thumbs up!! I work in a lab often leave my phone on desk and walk around benches and even cross the hall way to another room. I never get problem to receive BT signals from my iphone7. It's also easy to check battery status using iphone.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I had another pair of these that I ordered from Apple that were stolen and I was devastated because I love them so much that I ordered another pair. They are sound cancelling and comfortable sitting over the ear. I was never into bulky headphones like this before but after owning these I probably won't get anything else. I even use them when I shoot my gun because the noise cancelling is that good. I recommend them if you are considering buying them!,5.0 out of 5 stars
Great headset. Flawless pairing with all your apple devices. Legitimate 40 hours battery life and the range across our 3 level home no drops at all. The fatal flaw is i like to walk the dog in winter; if its cold; the unit shuts off purposely at around 32 degrees and no more music for the rest of the walk; i had 2 when i realized this i returned 1. They get more comfortable with continued use; not as comfy as the bose on ear bluetooth. Overall good purchase.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"Wow. If you are a bass lover and primarily listen to rap or R&B, you are certainly in for a treat. These look great and although the clarity is not quite as good as other brands such as Bose or Sennheiser, they excel in the bass department. They are sleek and beautiful making these the best looking headphones money can buy and won’t stick out if you so chose to wear them with your favorite outfit. Overall, I strongly recommend these to just about anybody looking for a great overall headphone with great sound quality, bass, battery, aesthetics, and style all in one.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"these are awful . at first I was really happy to get them and they looked really authentic and sounded great ! I’ve had them for almost a year now and as I was dancing and listening to my music, the right speaker stopped working . not to mention the circle part that allows you to change the volume randomly fell off on its own while I was listening to music maybe 6 months back . for 6 months I have been having it taped to my headphones just for them to end up trash all together . just save the money because these ain’t it .",1.0 out of 5 stars
If you like loud music beware. The wireless on these does not allow for loud music. I tested my regular Beats Solo with the same music and phone and the wireless just wont get as loud. I sent them back. Would rather deal with wires instead of not being able to enjoy loud music.,2.0 out of 5 stars

I bought these for my 9 year old for his birthday and we both love them. (I use them at the gym occasionally and have even run in them). The battery lasts forever and they look sharp but not too bulky. They are comfortable and the sound is very good. I like that they fold up nicely to fit in a small case that is easy to toss into a backpack or purse. I have been very happy with this purchase and I love the gold color. Not too flashy but still cool looking.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"I have had these for about a year and a half and the left earphone stopped working. If you do research, this is a VERY VERY common problem and it is not an easy fix or you'll have to send it in for repair which costs a significant amount of money. Extremely disappointed that I paid this much for head phones that barely last - and mine are in pristine condition physically. I gave Beats a chance after ignoring all the 'haters' online, and now I wish I would have listened. NEVER AGAIN.

"No active noise cancellation, the ear cups blocks some sound. I like the 40 hours play on single charge but ears get way too hot and sweaty! Little too tight for long uses, hopefully it will stretch out in time. Used it with the headphone jack and Bluetooth, the Bluetooth never dropped off. Let’s see if the sound quality gets better with use.",3.0 out of 5 stars
I actually like these and I am the furthest thing in the world from a Beats guy. The sound is fun they actually feel good on my head. Are the worth the $300 list price? Probably not but I got mine for $200 and you could probably do better than that. I just hope they hold up. Recommended.,5.0 out of 5 stars
"they fit a little tight on my head which makes it uncomfortable, but otherwise they are great. they charge so fast which is great! when you don’t have the headphones on you can hear what they are playing i would say pretty loudly, but i knew they were supposed to do that but people can easily hear what your listening to even if the it is at a very low volume.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Product has excellent sound quality and quick charging. The audio cord was broken when I received it. Thought no big deal since it was brand new and still under warranty. I was totally mistaken. When I called Apple to get a new cord, I was told that it was already out of warranty by two years. What??? The warranty started when the product was purchased two years ago by the seller (AMAZON) from Apple. Now that I know this, I will be very careful about what I purchase from Amazon. I ended up paying for a new audio cord.",5.0 out of 5 stars
I bought these headphones for my son who is autistic and hopes that it would help cancel out some of the noise around us while he was watching videos or listening to music.

I love them they are great. They have a great sound quality and are very comfortable. I was using them in a restaurant and I couldn't hear the music playing in the background.

Overrated in my opinion. I've owned these for a 1 year and 3 months and they are now dead. I used these 3 times a week at the gym. For $300.00 I feel like headphones should last a couple years. The once a month charging was nice but I will not be buying any more Beats.,1.0 out of 5 stars

"The sound is not audiophile quality, heavy on bass, and overall good sound quality.

This is the perfect wireless combination for iPhone 7, hands down.",4.0 out of 5 stars
"Not worth the price, sound is not of quality with other headphones of similar pricing, Bluetooth connectivity is spotty in a multiresidential environment and made with cheap materials. Mine broke at the plastic fold mechanism, leather always pulling apart from earpiece and I babied this headset. Band is really tight, ears hurt after less than an hour of use.

"My daughter got these Beats for Christmas 2017, in June 2018 one side of the headphones quit working! Apparently that is common. Apple replaced them free of charge and all was good. Then in January 2019 one side of the extension area broke. Once again I contacted Apple support, however this time instead of a 1 year warranty, the replacements only had a 90 day warranty!

"Great pair of legit easy to use Beats headphones. I registered my beats with the official Beats website and they are 100% authentic. It came in an original Beats box with easy to understand instructions . Sound quality is studio sound, noise cancellation is top notch and the material for the earmuffs is very comfortable. Battery life is considerably long while it doesn’t take long at all for a full charge. Apple device Bluetooth pairing is fast and easy(will pair with non apple device). Definitely a must buy for anyone looking for legit Beats headphones, especially if you have an iPhone.",5.0 out of 5 stars

Tried numerous sound settings on both my iPhone and my Mac. Still, it's solidly built but would recommend getting the extended warranty.

"After several weeks of researching, comparing and reading reviews, we bought the Beats Solo3 Wireless Headphones. I originally wanted the Bose QuietComfort 35’s or the Beats Studios. I tried them on, tested them out in-store and was having a hard time deciding. I saw a pair of th Solo3’s and tried them on, (not sure how I’d feel about the on-ear versus the over-the-eat style.) I was amazed that the Solo3 sounded just as great as the Bose (in my opinion). While not offering noise canceling, I could still hear most things around me with the Bose and Beats Studios. I felt the sound quality was just as good and I could hear just as much noise with the Solo3’s as the other two with noise-canceling. So we bought two, had them for 2 weeks now and traveled with them... we are extremely happy with them and would buy them again!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"The BEST headphones I have ever owned. Im a bit of a sucker for looks and brand which people criticize a lot of Beats users for but I say screw those people because you can have both looks AND quality with Beats. I had the beats solo 2 wireless and I cant begin to tell you what a step up the Solo 3's are. The battery life is seriously unbelievable. I use them ranging from 3-4 hours a day and sometimes up to 6 hours (I use them for work) and the battery lasts WEEKS its seriously incredible. When the battery gets low ill charge for 5 minutes and it's back up to 3 dots. It's INCREDIBLE, I dont even think my old Nokia's battery lasted this long! The finish of these headphones is about the same as the Solo 2's except for the gorgeous shiny rose gold accents as opposed to the fully matte finish of the Solo 2's. These headphones look amazing, sound even better, and the battery lasts a ridiculously long time. The price tag is hefty but as someone who uses these every day for work they were worth every penny.

I've noticed some people complaining about the same issue the Solo 2's had. It's uncomfortable to use them for an extended period of time because they are tight. Yes, at first they ARE pretty tight on your skull and are unbearable for over 2 hours. However, over time they DO stretch out and guys this happens to most On-Ear headphones. If you have very large ears I would recommend getting the Studios since they are OVER ear. If you want to speed out the stretch out process just stretch them out over something about the same size as your head and leave them overnight. Repeat this until they are comfy although dont stretch them too much or they will fall easily. I use these now for up to 6 hours at a time and they are very comfy. If you have earrings you might want to take them off before prolonged use, the back of the earrings will be poking into your skull.

Overall these headphones impressed me and this is coming from someone who already owned the great Solo 2's. You will not regret getting these.

"The sound quality was very good, but the headphones leak a lot of sound so if you're listening in a quiet place, everyone can hear your music.

Again though, if you plan on doing anything active, these are not the right ones. Update, the rubber cushion on the head strap came off of the headphones",5.0 out of 5 stars

"First I was spectical that these were even on sale because we all know Beats are overpriced for what you get. Thank being said, since these are discounted they are definitely a great buy. I wouldn't spend $300 on these but I will $220. These are real and they came in the original packaging.

Now for the review. As others have noticed that Beats are very bass heavy, I like this even though I listen to a lot of metal but to some they don't like it. The sound populated is excellent. There aren't any cracks or interruptions at all. These are a very high quality SOUND headphone. My issue isn't with the sound or the Bluetooth connectivity.

These headphones, as other solos are, are built cheap. The sound coming out is great but the design is made out of plastic and i wouldn't recommend anyone going to the gym with these. Get the power beats if you're going to the gym. These feel like they will break and I have a feeling they will If I drop them hard enough. The ear cups re great leather quality and feel comfortable. I wish they went away with the plastic and made all the models like the beats pro were. The material in the design definitely needs work.

The Bluetooth connectivity is marvelous with this W1 chip. The range is insane. I went outside my house and down the street and was still connected without interuption. i don't understand everyone saying connecting is any different. Yes there's a pop up that says connect but all my other bluetooth headphones automatically connect after the initial set up anyway so I don't get this ""amaazing set up"" everyone is talking about.

One more thing I would like to point out are phone calls. The phone calls are so crystal clear. No one can tell I'm using headphones which is hard with Bluetooth nowadays. All around these are a great buy and I would buy them again (not for $300 of course). Sound quality is great, cal quality is great, if you can get over the plastic buy these!",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Good sounding headphones, just didn't like the fact they look bulky on your head, meaning they stick out really far. They don't cover your whole ear like the Studio's do. They are also I bit tight if you don't have a small head. Other than that , they work well.

I’ve onky fully charged this set of headphones once since I bought them. I’ve taken them to the gym at least 30 minutes maybe 8-10 times and haven’t had to recharge them. They fit pretty comfortably and don’t really squeeze to tight. They sound great except not as loud as a previous set that I own. Th bass is not where near what it used to be. But over all still pretty good,5.0 out of 5 stars

But i believe they are fake because the W1 chip it is supposed to have didnt connect to my ipad air 2 like advertised, and the comfort of these headphones werent the same as the ones i wore in store at best buy. And the sound quality was pathetic, my cheap asus laptop has better sound than these.",1.0 out of 5 stars
"So I know everyone is seeing all these one star reviews and how they’re fake and too cheap and stuff however, I checked the serial number, and everything was in check and these are indeed 100% real beats.

If anything happens In the next 4 months, I’ll probably take this review down or just add on but bottom line is that the beats I received were in fact real beats",5.0 out of 5 stars

The case is sleek & provides good protection.,5.0 out of 5 stars

"The sound is amazing and they're so comfortable! I think these are the best headphones I've ever had.

IMPORTANT NOTE: You should get a hard case to store them.

Some months after the purchase, the left headphone just stopped working when connected to bluetooth, but it worked perfectly fine when I used the 3,5mm jack. Luckily, I managed to get some new ones from Apple.

My guess is that storing them in the provided fabric bag harmed somehow the wiring, since the headphones barely fit in it.",5.0 out of 5 stars

"Great that I received someone else's used beats... I was a little skeptical when the box was not even wrapped. When I opened it, the headphones were scratched up and the cups had earwax in them. Absolutely unlike Amazon to send used beats when they are marked as new. When I paired to the device, it already pops up as Christian's beats solo 3. So Christian, absolutely brilliant but you need to clean your ears. As if that wasn't enough, the left ear just did not work at all. Very disappointed. Save yourself the trouble, buy these at best buy for the same price.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"These are the second pair of beats I have purchased, and they are great. I know they get a lot of complaints by music professionals as not being ""the"" top quality music output. However, to my amateur ears, I think that they are perfectly fine. The battery lasts forever....I usually have to charge them only every 2-3 weeks, and use them almost every day. Compared to pretty much any other rechargeable product, their battery life is amazing. I don't know how many long haul flights I have planned, and the morning of realized that I had forgotten to charge my ipad/computer...etc. These headphones are great, since they last so long. The music quality is more than sufficient for me, and the fact that they fold up means I can throw them in my purse pretty easily. I use them on my commute, for travel, and when I work out!

The only reason I would rate this product a 4, and not higher, is because if I wear them for too long they start to hurt my head from the position. This could just be a personal problem.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"I obviously bought this pair of headphones for the appearance, and it doesn’t disappoint. But the sound is meh, and they squeeze my head like a vice grip, so I can’t say I don’t have some regrets. I wish there was a way to relax the tension on the headband so it’s not so tight.",4.0 out of 5 stars
I love them. Easy to pair with my car and Android phone. Beautiful. Expensively made. A little tight at first but better tight than lose for years of wear because the leather may give in time and you don't want them falling off. Sound quality could use improvement. Base versus treble and clear ness.,4.0 out of 5 stars
"6 months after purchasing the product new, one side stopped working. Amazon is the seller and they had purchased this product from Apple the year before, so we learned that the warranty wouldn’t cover it and the cost to repair ($300) was twice the purchase cost ($160). I guess next time we purchase the extra warranty, research it more, or purchase a product that will last more than 6 months.",1.0 out of 5 stars

These fell apart in less than a year. I know they were well loved but for the price they should have lasted. A 13 year old tending to them. Not a young kid.

"Quality of sound is amazing. This is the second pair I’ve owned (first pair was stolen out of car). I was determined to replace them. Finally did and frankly a little disappointed in the actual hardware.

Aside from defect disappointment of this pair, highly recommend the brand.",4.0 out of 5 stars

"These are so awesome. I really wanted wireless headphones that would stay put while I was working out, and these do a beautiful job with that. So, I can work out, listen to amazing quality sound, and never re-adjust. I could get all technical and specific but I think that says it all!! They're pricey but so worth it!

Even using different EQ settings it just didn't have the quality of sound I've found from less expensive Bluetooth headphones. They have great battery life and range, but if you like to hear bass like, like a bass chello. Forget it. Even in deep bass EQ. it's a no go.

"Apple has a problem with the batteries in their headphones. I've bought 4 pairs of them either for myself or as gifts and 2 of them have had the same battery failure issue. Eventually they just stop charging. Then you have to drive into the Apple store, wait in line, have them send them out, and drive back. Fortunately they often get stolen before they fail. That's about the best feature. The sound is good when they work. Would never buy another pair.",1.0 out of 5 stars

These headphones worked fine yesterday and most of today. Then suddenly the sound is super muffled and I have no idea why. Not sure if I got a defective pair or if these are knockoffs. They have been kept in their case when not on my head because they seem delicate. If the sound doesn't randomly snap back they are going to be worthless.,1.0 out of 5 stars

The on the ear design isn’t comfortable and I can’t tell if that is just because they are on my ears instead of over them as my bose are or if the band is just too small for my head and is squeezing the ear pieces to my ears instead applying a little pressure to keep them in place,2.0 out of 5 stars

"Wanted a decent pair of wireless headphones after always catching a cord at work and breaking other pairs. I looked at a few pairs, these, some Bose headphones and some V-Moda. Honestly these probably had the lowest reviews of the 3. Not bad reviews, but lower than the other two in general so I was hesitant. I also had never read great things about older Beats, but they came down in price some to about 70 less than the other two so I decided to give it a shot.

I am pleasantly surprised. I am by no means an audiophile so that may help, but I think they sound very good. Pretty full sound, I don't think it's the best by any means, but it's a good sound and enjoyable to listen to. Range also seems really good on the bluetooth.

As far as comfort. They definitely could be tight to some. They kind of clamp down on the ears. I don't find this bad, but it's definitely something to consider in a purchase. I think overall they are very comfortable so far. A little hot under the ears after a bit maybe, but not bad.

I would recommend them if you want a decent pair of wireless headphones. Good sound, easy to pair, comfortable. Oh, and it also came with 30 bucks on the itunes store or 3 months of apple music. Since I will use that it's like I saved another 30 bucks on them which really makes them a great deal.",5.0 out of 5 stars
"Great depending on where you live.

Headphones have a safety measure built in to cut the headphones off below 32*F. I live in DC....I can’t get 5 minutes out the door without them cutting off in late fall/winter. For the price point that’s unacceptable.",2.0 out of 5 stars

"Pretty disappinted. I take very good care of the headphones, and less than a year after buying them, the cover for the cable mic has come off and cannot be put back again so the cables are exposed.

"I am extremely pleased with this purchase. First of all, it arrived on time and in great condition. I was a bit skeptical about purchasing due to some of the comments that I read, however, I decided to bite the bullet and make the purchase. There were concerns if the headphones were genuine (as in, true Beats)- yes, they are. These Beats by Dre wireless headphones are the best, I do not know why I waited so long to make the purchase! The sound is crisp and clear and my music sounds like it is live.

Setup was not difficult and I like that it automatically pairs with my phone so I can listen to my music. I have a Samsung S7 and it works perfectly- no problems at all.

I purchased these headphones for the gym. I lift weights, spin, and run in them. I have not experienced the issue some people complain about regarding sweating (and I tend to sweat when I am running). My headphones still stay on my head. For those that have that issue, I would recommend tying a scarf on your head. It will help hold the headphones in place.

Overall, I am a satisfied customer.",5.0 out of 5 stars
These headphones are trash to put it simply. The sound quality is not as good as I thought it would be. I had the original beats the they first came out and those were so much better in terms of sound and product quality. I was really excited about these but ended up very disappointed. I'm returning them for my money back. Not at all impressed.,2.0 out of 5 stars

Purchased the headphones April 2017. By April 2018 the cover on the headphones started to come off. I contacted Apple to repair but they said it would cost $130 to repair because I was out of the one year warranty. now the entire ear muff has come off. I would suggest get an extended warranty if you are going to buy these are buy another product.,1.0 out of 5 stars
"Worked fine with apple watch at the gym every day for 5 months. then one day they acted like they had no battery life; wouldn't turn on. followed Dr Dre Beat website instructions for resetting them, but I all I could get is the power led on (white) and a one red led.",1.0 out of 5 stars

"I got these a few days ago and they were perfect, I had a long debate on whether I should get the Bose headphones or these Beats. The Beats won out. However after only a few days of ownership they are already malfunctioning. On two separate occasions while working out at the gym the volume levels would change on their own. Which doesn’t seem too bad I guess But considering these headphones are over $200 I was hoping for a good quality product. I am currently waiting on replacements and fingers crossed this doesn’t happen again otherwise I guess I will just go for the Bose.

Update: decided to just get a refund and go with another brand entirely after reading more negative reviews",3.0 out of 5 stars

"I had the Beats Studio Wireless headphones and bought the Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones yesterday. I did a side by side comparison and I gotta say, the Solo 3's sound better.... way better. I know Beats are geared more toward a the low end of the sound spectrum, but I played Hip Hop, Classical, Country, Rock and some Acapela. Every test had the Solo 3's as the clear winner. Even down to the sound isolation, and the Studios have ""noise cancellation"".

There's only one negative, it is the carrying case. Could they not make it a tad bigger?! I feel like just one more centimeter of room would have shaved at least 3 minutes off putting them in the bag. ;)

I have to be transparent, I got these for $210 on another large retailer's site (think the rain forest). Would I pay 300 plus tax? Probably, but the point is, you can't find them for less, just make sure the place you're buying them from is legit.",5.0 out of 5 stars
